STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  3/26 Sect ion 1 – PWI Pump Description  
 
The PumpWorks 610 PWI pump is a single  stage , vertical in-line c entrifugal pump manufactured 
in accordance with the American Petroleum Institute (API) Standard 610.  
 
Our PWI -BB (OH3) design features a vertical bearing housing system to take the radial and 
axial forces  exerted upon the pump,  and connects the pump and driver with a flexible spacer 
coupling. The standard PWI (OH4) design relies on the bearings in the vertical driver to take the 
forces, and utilizes a rigid spacer coupling design. Both systems allow for the removal of the 
mechanical seal without removing the driver  or suction and discharge piping.  
 
NOTE : All reference numbers (provided in parentheses) in this manual refer to the typical 
sectional drawing, Figure 3 . 
 
Section 2 -  Handling & Storage  
 
Inspection  
 
Upon receipt, carefully inspect the unit for damage and validate  against the bill of lading. Report 
any damaged  or missing items  to the carrier's local representative and submit  a copy  of the 
report  to PumpWorks  610. While removing packaging  do not  discard any small accessories t hat 
may be attached . 
 
Handling  
 Lift the complete unit using the provided lifting lugs on the pump driver stand (3160) with proper 
lifting techniques.  
 
 
Storage - Short Term 
 
When storing  the unit for less than 6 months prior to installation, store  on a skid in a dry location 
to protect the unit  from moisture, sand, grit and other contaminants. Do not remove the provided 
protective covers on the suction and discharge flanges.  
 
Storage - Long Term 
 
When storing the unit more than 6 months prior to installation, t he pump must be cov ered or 
stored indoors . Perform the following  upon receipt and at 6 month intervals:  
 
1. (PWI -BB only) Prior to storage, remove the oil vent plug and fill the bearing housing with one 
quart of vapor emitting oil. Reinstall vent plug.   ",3,PWI_IOM.pdf

equivalent rust preventative.  
3. Rotate pump shaft (2210) 3.5 turns (180 º from original position).  
4. Remove the protective covers on the suction and discharge flanges.  Remove any visible rust 
on internal surfaces and coat with a li ght petroleum grease or equivalent rust  preventative. 
Replace protective covers on the flanges.  
 
NOTE: Accumulation of condensation in the unit  must be avoided. Store the unit away from 
climatic extremes.  
 
When auxiliary equipment such as drivers, mechanic al seals (4200) , or instrumentation is 
provided, additional preparation for long  term storage  may be required . Refer to the appropriate 
manufacturer's literature for specific instructions.  
 
 
Section 3 -  Installation  
 
General  
 
Support and anchor suction and discharge piping independently near the pump so strain will not 
be transmitted to the pump casing  when flange bolting is tightened. Piping must independently 
align with the pump flanges;  never  force piping into place at suction or discharge flanges.  
 
If an expansion joint or non- rigid pipe coupling is used, install a pipe anchor as near to the 
suction and/or discharge flanges as possible. Proper installation of the pipe anchor will eliminate any undesirable forces on the pump. Use large -radius elbows wherev er possible.   Flush all 
piping thoroughly to remove any foreign matter before connecting  to the pump.  Per the 
Hydraulic Institute, there should be at least five to ten pipe diameters of straight pipe length coming into the suction before the first fitting,  strainer, or valve is installed, and it is preferable to 
have the same conditions after the discharge.  
 
Location  
 
The unit should be positioned as close to the suction source as practical , in order to optimize 
suction conditions, while ensuring sufficient  clearance around the unit to allow for cooling and 
maintenance accessibility.

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  5/26 Suction Piping  
 
1. The nominal suction pipe diameter must be the same size as  the nominal suction flange size.  
 
2. Ensure that suction lines are sealed to avoid leakage and air pockets.  
 3. Per the Hydraulic Institute, r educers, if used, should be of the conical type and sufficiently 
long to prevent fluid turbulence. Contour type reducers are not recommended..  Eccentric or 
concentric reducers may be used when the liquid source is above the pump and the suction 
piping is sloping upwards toward the source.  
  
4. Start -up, cone -type suction strainers should be used and must have a net free area of at least 
three times the suction pipe area; they should point upstream into oncoming flow. 
 5. Install ing a gate valve in the suction line permit s closing the line for pump inspection and 
maintenance.   
 
CAUTION: Never throttle the pump with the suction valve; while pump is in operation, this valve 
should always
 be fully open.  
 
Discharge Pi ping  
 1. A check valve and gate valve should be installed in the discharge piping.  The check valve, 
placed between the unit  and gate valve, prevents pumpage from running back through the unit. 
The gate valve is used in priming, starting,  and shutdown of the unit and to control discharge 
flow. 
 
2. If increasers are used in  the discharge piping , they should be located between the check 
valve and the unit .

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  6/26 Section 4 -  Preparing for Operation  
 
General  
 
When pumps and drivers are received from the factory wit h the motor installed and pinned  on 
the pump driver stand, they have been accurately aligned before shipment.  Realignment is 
necessary after t he suction and discharge piping have been installed.  
 
Alignment should be checked after working on the mechanical seal or removing the driver  to 
ensure minimal repair and maintenance of the unit  after re -assembly .  
 
Driver Lubrication  
 
Motor bearings should be serviced and lubricated as outlined in the motor manufacturer's 
instructions.   For the PWI  (OH4) , all pump hy draulic thrust loads  are taken by the motor 
bearings .  
 
Bearing Housing Lubrication (PWI -BB only ) 
 
The bearing housing incorporates an oil flinger and pumping ring to circulate oil to the bearings. 
Fill the bearing housing to the proper level (Centerline of the bull’s eye) with ISO/ASTM VG 32 
oil. For lubrication changi ng intervals, refer to Section 7 Operational Checks.  
 The constant level oiler bottle will be found already mounted to the bearing housing. Adjustment 
should be made as detailed below:  
 
Fill the bearing housing with proper grade of oil through the constant level oiler cup to 1/4"" (6.35 
millimeters) below the level mark. Then fill the oiler bottle with oil and place it in the oiler cup. 
The housing is filled when oil remains in the oiler bottle.  
 If the oil level is not at the proper level, remove bottle and reset level adjuster (See Figure 1 ). 
Replace bottle (repeat operation until proper level is obtained). Thereafter, it is only necessary 
to keep bottle filled with oil.

Mechanical Seals  
 
As a standard, the PWI  pump is equipped  with a cartridge- type mechanical seal (4200), which 
complies with the service requirements outlined on the pump data sheet. The seals are factory -
installed , and no adjustment is required.  
 NOTE: Seal settin g devices must be disengaged prior to start -up, but are required to be 
installed when removal of the coupling spacer is necessary.  The mechanical seal is not 
designed to withstand the entire weight of the rotating assembly.  
 
Seal Flush Piping  
 
Seal flush piping should be installed in accordance with the service requirements outlined in the 
pump data sheet and the seal manufacturer's recommendations. Vent seal cavity to prime seal 
and piping prior to start up. Refer to the general arrangement drawing and auxiliary  system IOM 
details, as necessary, provided in the final data package .  
 
Rotation  
 
The driver rotation must be verified prior to start -up. To check rotation, remove the coupling 
guard and coupling spacer  to disengage the pump from the driver . Make m omentary contact 
with the motor starter , also known as a “bump test”,  to verify correct rotation.

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  8/26 WARNING: Keep clear of rotating components when checking the motor rotation. Be sure that 
tools and loose hardware are clear before starting motor.  
 
Alignment of Spacer Type Couplings (OH4 only)  
 
WARNING: Be sure that power to the motor is off and locked out before removing or installing 
the coupling or coupling guard.  
 
A spacer type coupling is used between the pump and driver. To align the spacer coupling, first 
replace the mechanical seal setting devices per the seal manufacturer’s guidelines , loosen the 
set screws fastening the seal drive collar to the shaft , remove the spacer between the pump and 
driver, then remove the pump coupling hub and mechanical seal.  Either construct solid 
brackets or use magne tic clamps, as shown in Figure 2, in order to hold both dial indicators at  
the required locations.  
  
NOTE: All T.I.R. measurements are to be taken perpendicularly to each face marked in Figure 
2. 
 
Position 1:  Fix one bracket /clamp to the motor coupling hub horizontal face and assemble the 
dial indicator so that it is located and oriented on the seal c hamber bore.  Fix the other 
bracket/clamp to the pump seal chamber horizontal face and assemble the dial indicator so that it is located and oriented on the outer diameter of the motor coupling  hub flange as shown.   
Maximum total run- out readings on both dial indicators shall be per coupling manufacturer 
recommendation, and not exceed 0 .005” T.I.R.   If the runout exceeds this value, loosen the 
motor mounting bolts and realign the motor.  Once the motor is realigned, carefully tighten the 
motor mounting bolts and repeat this procedure as many times as necessary.  
 NOTE: It is not necessary to have two dial indicators.  Position 1 can be done as a two- step 
process with a single indicator.  
 Position 2: Using the first bracket mounted to the motor hub, align the dial indicator on the back 
face of the case cover plate.  The runout should not exceed 0.002”.  
 
Position 3: Mount  a bracket on the back of the case cover face, seen as the left bracket in the 
figure, and align the indicator to the inside edge of the motor hub.  The runout should not exceed 
0.0005” . 
 
Position 4: Using the same bracket mounting face location from the third position, check the 
runout of the motor hub by indicating on the face as shown.  This runout should also not exceed 
0.0005”.  
 
Position 5: Do a final check on the pump shaft by fully assembling the coupling and setting up a 
bracket on the case cover face  and indicating on the shaft.  This runout should not exceed 
0.002”.

High Temperature Operation  
 
Pumps handling liquids at temperatures above 300º  F (150º C) should be gradually brought to 
operating temperature prior to  start-up. This can be accomplished by circulating hot pumpage 
through the pump and controlling  the circulation so that the pump casing temperature rise does 
not exceed 150º F (37.8º C) per hour. The pump casing temperature must be within 75º F (24º 
C) of the pumpage before star t-up and operation.  
 WARNING: Bring  the pump up to the operating temperature slowly before start up. Severe 
thermal shock can damage the pump and cause injury . ",9,PWI_IOM.pdf

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  10/26 Section 5 – Operation  
Operating Capacity  
 
Centrifugal pumps should not be operated at greatly r educed capacity or with a closed 
discharge valve because the energy required to drive the pump is converted to heat and the 
temperature of the liquid may reach its bubble point. If this occurs, the rotating parts are 
exposed to vapor with no lubrication and damage to internal parts will occur.  
 There are several ways  to protect the pump from damage:  
 
1. Add a l iquid temperature sensor to shut the pump down if the pumpage temperature 
exceeds a predetermined level.  See the High Temperatur e Operation passage of 
Section 4 for some guidelines.  
2. Add a flow meter to the suction with an alarm level set for the minimum continuous safe 
flow (MCSF) ability of the pump, which can be found on the pump data sheet. Operating 
below the MCSF increases the radial loading on the s ystem, which can lead to 
shortened bearing life, increases the NPSH of the pump, and can lead to internal 
cavitation.  
3. Installing a constant open minimum -flow by -pass between the pump discharge and the 
suction source should unexpected blockage occur in the pipeline.  
4. Adding a suction pressure sensor upstream from the pump to shut the pump down if the 
suction pressure drops below a predetermined level.  
5. Adding a vibration sensor to shut the pump down if the vibration level exceeds a 
predetermined value.  
 
NOTE:  Never throttle pump on suction side.  The suction valve should always
 be fully open 
during pump operation.  
 
Freezing  
 During cold weather when the pump is not in operation, the pump should be drained to prevent 
the liquid inside from freezing.  Proper stora ge procedures should be followed while the pump is 
not in use.  
 WARNING: If the pumpage is toxic, flammable, or corrosive, take proper precautions for 
handling pumpage before draining the pump.  
 
Shut-Down 
 
To avoid water hammer, it is recommended that the discharge valve be partially closed to the 
minimum flow point just prior to shut -down of the pump.  ",10,PWI_IOM.pdf

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  11/26 Section 6 -  Starting the Pump  
 
Start-up Checklist  
 
Before starting the pump, check the following: 
 
_ Pump rotation direction matches motor rotation direction (bump test)  
_ Seal setting devices removed per seal manufacturer’s recommendations  
_ Seal flush piping is properly installed  
_ Pump vent and drain lines installed, and any vent and drain valves  closed after pump is 
primed.  
_ Motor bearings lubricated per motor manu facturer’s recommendations  
_ (PWI -BB only) Pump bearing housing has the appropriate level of oil to lubricate the 
pump bearings.  
_ Pipe connections and plugs tightened and sealed 
_ Coupling spacer installed and pump and driver aligned  
_ Pump shaft rotates 360º freely  
_ Coupling guards installed 
_ Pump and all auxiliary systems are fully vented  
_ Suction valve fully open 
_ Discharge valve in start -up position  
_ Instrumentation connections made  
_ All personnel clear of equipment  
 Priming  
 
NOTE: The pump casing, suction line and seal flush must be filled with liquid and fully vented  
BEFORE the pump is started.   
 
Starting  
 
A centrifugal pump usually requires less power to operate with the discharge valve closed than 
with the discharge valve open. For this reason, it is recommended that this valve be partially 
closed when starting . However, ensure the pump is not operating below the minimum 
stable flow conditions at any time . 
 
Start the pump and immediately bring  to operating speed. Slowly open the discharge valve as 
soon as there is  a discharge pressure indication. Continue opening the discharge valve until 
rated capacity and discharge pressure are obtained. If the rated conditions cannot be obtained, 
refer to the Trouble Checklist in Section 8 . ",11,PWI_IOM.pdf

STDS- PWI-IOM-TM-0.0  12/26 Section 7 -  Operational Checks  
 
First 60 Minutes  
 
It is recommended that the following parameters be recorded at 10 minute intervals during the 
first 60 minutes of operation and periodically thereafter:  
 
1. Suction and discharge pressures  
2. Pumpage temperature  
3. Vibration levels  
4. Leakage 
5. (PWI -BB only) Bearing housing temperature  
 
Satisfactory operation is i ndicated by correct capacity,  discharge pressure, and low vibration 
levels . Keep records for future troubleshooting reference and performance trend analysis.  
 
A periodic check of the items listed above will ensure the pump is maintained in its best 
operating condition.  
 
Mechanical Seal  
 
Check mechanical seals for leakage during the first hours of operation.  Minor leakage through 
the seal usually stops after a short operation period,  but, if leakage  continues , shut down the 
pump and investigate the cause. Excessive leakage past the seal generally indicates worn or 
broken parts requiring replacement.  
 
Lubrication  
 
Driver Lubrication  
 
Driver bearings should be serviced and lubricated acco rding to the motor manufacturer's 
instructions. Consult lubrication directions on nameplate and literature provided in the final data 
package.  
 
Pump Lubrication (PWI-BB Only)  
 
Great care should be exercised to keep the housing clean and only clean lubricants should be 
used. Foreign solids or liquids within the bearing housing can completely ruin the bearings in a 
short time. Keep the oiler bottle filled with the correct grade of oil  (See Section 4) . Under normal 
conditions the oiler will maintain proper oil  level. A routine check of the oil level will verify proper 
working order of the oiler.  
 
After the initial start -up, change the oil after 24 hours of running time. Thereafter, change the oil 
at the following intervals:  ",12,PWI_IOM.pdf

Table 1  
 
When changing the oil, flush the inside of the housing with clean oil to remove any accumulated 
contaminants.  
 Due to rolling friction and drag of the bearing races, heat is generated within the bearings and 
they will operate at temperatures above the surrounding atmosphere unless cooled. Oil 
lubricated ball bearings can safely be operated up to 180° F (82.2° C) and bearing temperatures 
of 160°F (71.1 °C) are normal. Do not use the human hand as a thermometer.  Determine the 
temperatures accurately by placing a contact type thermometer against the bearing housing. Record this temperature on a regular basis and maintain a log of the reading. A stable 
temperature indicates normal operation.  
 
Sudden increases in temperature or excessively high temperature are indications of operational 
problems or a pending bearing failure.  
 
Check to see that oil is of proper viscosity and the oil level is neither  too high nor too low.  
 
The unit should also be checked for unstable hydraulic operation and unnecessary mechanical 
loads, such as shaft misalignment.  
 
 
Bearing Housing Temperatures  
 
Periodically check bearing housing surface temperature. Normal bearing h ousing 
operating temperature is 125° -  180° F (50º -  80º C).  
 
NOTE: Stop the pump immediately if bearing housing temperature exceeds 190° F (88° 
C). Inspect for possible problems such as those stated above before restarting the 
pump.  
 NOTE: Bearing housings equipped with water cooling coils  are to be adjusted to 
operate so as to maintain an oil temperature no less than 25°F above the 
surrounding ambient temperature to prevent condensation.  ",13,PWI_IOM.pdf

NOTE: For materials with known galling tendencies , and for all materials operating at 
temperatures above 500 º F, add 0.005""(127 micrometers) to the above diametr ical clearances. 
Pumps utilizing special non- galling wear materials may use smaller wear ring clearances.  The 
clearances referenced above act as a guideline, with the final clearances determined by 
PumpWorks 610 for each process condition.  
 
Seals  
 
Inspect all mechanical seals (4200) for irregularities or damage. Consult the seal manufacturer's 
data for seal reconditioning and service. Seal faces, ""O"" rings and the seal sleeve must be in 
perfect condition. Replace all worn parts.  
 
Shaft  
 
Inspect the shaft (2110)  for damage and straightness. Dress minor damage and polish areas 
where the shaft contacts a seal. Support the shaft in rollers or V -blocks about ¼ of the overall 
length from each end and check run -out. Run- out must not exceed .002 inch TIR on all 
diameter s. 
 
General  
 
All parts should be cleaned before assembly. This is especially important at ""O"" ring grooves, 
threads, cylindrical fits and gasket surfaces. Any burred edge must be removed before part is 
installed into the pump. Coat all parts with light oil  and cover with protective cloth if the pump is 
not immediately reassembled.  ",19,PWI_IOM.pdf

3. Warnings
1. Read	through	the	instructions	before	installing	the	pump	and	
starting	it	up.	If	in	doubt,	contact	your	local	SPX	Flow	 Technology	
representative.
2. Check	that	the	specifications	of	the	motor	and	motor	control	unit	are	
correct.	This	applies	in	particular	to	applications	which	carry	a	risk	of	
explosion.
3. Observe	 that	a	pump	may	be	unstable	 and	may	tilt	to	the	fore	onto	its	
inlet port when having a relatively small motor and being assembled 
on	brackets	instead	of	being	equipped	with	a	frame	with	adjustable	
feet.	Be	careful	during	the	installation	of	such	a	pump.	(For	this	
reason, the W+50/600 pump is equipped with an anti-tilting unit.)
4. Do	not	start	the	pump	before	all	pipe	connections	have	been	fitted	
carefully	and	tightened.	Special	precautions	must	be	taken	when	
the	pump	is	used	to	pump	hot	and/or	hazardous	liquids.	In	such	
cases	follow	the	local	regulations	for	personal	safety	when	working	
with	these	products.
5. Do	not	start	the	pump	before	the	motor	shroud	or	shaft	guard	has	been	
securely	fitted.
6. The	pump	contains	rotating	parts.	Never	put	your	hands,	fingers	or	
objects	into	a	pump	while	it	is	in	operation.
7. Never	touch	the	shroud	during	operation,	as	it	can	become	very	hot.
8. Never	touch	the	pump	body	during	operation	 if	the	pump	is	being	used	
for	hot	media,	as	there	is	a	risk	of	being	burnt.
9. If	the	pump	is	operating	with	liquid	media	but	has	no	circulation,	the	
liquid	will	heat	up	and	may	turn	into	vapour,	which	could	cause	an	
explosion.
10. Always	remove	all	assembly	 and	auxiliary	 tools	from	the	pump	before	
starting it up.
11. Never	hose	down	or	clean	the	electric	motor	directly	with	water	
or	cleaning	fluid.
12. Never	lift	the	pump	at	the	shroud,	as	it	is	not	designed	to	carry	the	
weight	of	the	motor.	Remove	the	shroud	before	lifting	the	pump.	
Always	use	securely	fitted	lifting	straps	when	lifting	with	a	crane	
or	similar	lifting	gear.
13. Never	dismantle	the	pump	before	the	motor	has	been	disconnected	
from	the	power	supply.	Remove	the	fuses	and	disconnect	the	cable	
from	the	motor	terminal	box.
14. The	installation	of	all	electrical	parts	must	be	carried	out	by	qualified	
personnel.

3. Warnings
15. Never	dismantle	the	pump	until	the	pipe	system	has	been	
drained.	Remember	that	liquid	will	always	collect	in	the	pump	
body.	If	the	pump	is	to	be	used	for	hot	and/or	hazardous	liquids,	
special	precautions	must	be	taken.	In	such	cases	follow	the	local	
regulations	for	personal	safety	when	working	with	these	products.
16. The	following	values	specified	for	the	permissible	pressure	
must	not	be	exceeded:
Max. 18 bar W+10/8, W+22/20, W+30/80, W+35/55, W+35/35, 
W+110/130
Max. 14 bar W+25/210, W+30/120,W+50/600, W+50/8, 
W+55/35, W+55/60, W+60/110, W+65/350, 
W+70/40, W+80/80
The	a.m.	values	are	also	valid	for	the	corresponding	models	in	the 	
Wa+ and Wi+ ranges. It is important to remember that the maximum 
outlet	pressure	values	apply	when	water	is	at	a	temperature	of	20°C.

5. Installation of pump
5.1 Positioning
The	following	must	be	observed:  
The	pump	must	be	positioned	so	that	the	suction	pipe	is	as	short	as	
possible	and	there	is	a	sloping	gradient	towards	the	suction	port	of	
the pump.
Keep	the	number	of	valves,	bends	and	tee-pieces	on	the	suction	
side to an absolute minimum.
There	must	be	sufficient	space	around	the	pump	for	piping	and	
access	for	maintenance.
5.2 Lining up the pipe system
Ensure that the pipe system is adequately underpinned with pipe 
supports	so	that	the	pump	body	is	not	subject	to	strain	from	or	the	
weight	of	the	pipe	system.
Caution! During	the	suction	process,	the	pump	may	tend	
to	vibrate.	 A	pipe	support	should	be	placed	close	
to	the	pump	suction	to	prevent	pipework	vibration	
creating	excessive	noise.
5.3 Power supply
The	motor	must	be	connected	via	a	control	cabinet	to	the	network	in	
compliance	with	the	local	regulations.	Moreover,	the	motor	must	be	
connected	in	accordance	with	the	instructions	indicated	in	the	inner	
side	of	the	connecting	box	lid	of	the	motor.
The	motor	should	be	connected	in	such	a	way	that	the	motor	and	
therefore	the	impeller	are	anti-clockwise	when	viewed	from	the	front	
in	the	direction	of	the	suction	port	of	the	pump	body.	(Fig.	4).
5.4 Liquid supply for flushed shaft seal
Pumps	with	a	flushed	shaft	seal	are	fitted	with	two	PTFE	hose 	
connectors	on	the	sealing	flange.	 The	hose	connectors	are	1/8	inch 	
and	fit	6.0	mm	hoses.	 The	required	flow	quantity	amounts	to	15–30	l/h.
The maximum permissible pressure is 7 bar.
The	hose	connection	should	always	be	positioned	vertically	with	
the	fluid	inlet	below	and	the	outlet	above	(Fig.	5).
Fluid	consumption	can	be	limited	by	installing	a	solenoid	valve	on	
the	supply	side.	 The	open/close	function	of	the	solenoid	valve	can	
be	controlled	by	the	pump's	start/stop	sequence.
Do	not	use	steam	or	steam	condensate	on	the	connection	for	
flushing	liquids.	If	you	wish	to	use	steam	as	a	sealant,	a	special	
aseptic	pipe	connector	must	be	used.
For	connectors	see	5.5.
5.5 Connecting steam and steam condensate for aseptic use
When	static	double	seals	are	used,	the	connection	for	steam	or	
steam	condensate	at	the	pump	body	is	provided	with	fittings	for	
8 mm stainless steel pipes.
Steam	of	up	to	150°C	and	5	bar	can	be	used.	Fig. 4

6. Start-up and operation
Before	starting	the	pump,	dismantle	and	clean	the	suction	pipe.	  
Any	foreign	material	in	the	pump	should	be	removed.
6.1 Checking the pump for foreign material
Remove	the	pump	body	as	described	below.	 The	sectional	drawing	
(page	3)	is	to	be	used	for	reference	purposes.
1. Disconnect	the	power	supply.
2. Remove	 the	pump	body	(items	1a,	1b)	by	unscrewing	 the	clamp	ring	
(item	9a)	or	body	screws,	and	carefully	extract	from	the	body.
3. Turn	the	impeller	(item	4)	to	ensure	that	there	is	no	foreign	material	
behind it.
4. Remove	any	foreign	material	from	inside	the	pump.
5. When	the	pump	body	is	clean	and	free	of	foreign	material,	 reassemble	
the pump.
Mount	the	pump	body	as	described	below:
6. Check	that	the	locating	pin	(item	8),	which	is	installed	 in	the	top	of	the	
back	plate,	fits	with	the	detent	in	the	pump	body	and	carefully	(to	
avoid	damage	to	the	O-ring)	press	the	pump	body	(item	1a,	1b)	
in	so	it	covers	the	O-ring	(item	6).	 Then	fasten	with	the	clamp	ring	
(item	9a)	or	body	screws	and	apply	the	correct	tightening	torque.
M10:	 max.	35	Nm	(25	ft-lb)
7. Check	that	the	pipe	unions	have	been	tightened	 properly	 and	that	the	
pipe	supports	have	been	fitted.
To	facilitate	the	fitting	of	the	front	cover	and	pump	housing,	we	
recommend	that	the	O-ring	is	lubricated	with	a	thin	layer	of	food-
friendly,	acid-free	grease	or	soap.

6. Start-up and operation
6.2 Checking the pump
To	check	that	the	pump	is	working	satisfactorily,	pour	water	into	
the	pump	and	start	it	momentarily.	Check	the	direction	of	rotation.	
Fig.	6.	Listen	for	any	unusual	noises.
In	pumps	with	water-flushed	or	steam-flushed	shaft	seals,	the	seal	
chamber	must	be	filled	with	water/steam.
Caution! Never	allow	the	pump	to	run	without	liquid,	as	this	
will	ruin	the	shaft	seal.
6.3 Starting the pump
Check	the	following	before	starting	the	pump:
 -That	the	shaft	guard	has	been	fitted	properly.
 -That	there	is	unobstructed	access	for	liquid	and	that	the	pump	is	
primed.
 -That	the	valve	on	the	discharge	side	is	closed.
The	valve	on	the	discharge	side	is	closed	during	start-up	to	prevent	
the	motor	from	overloading,	but	should	be	opened	again	as	soon	as	
the pump has been started.
Note! The	pump	should	not	be	left	running	too	long	without	pumping	
(typically	15	minutes	if	the	pumped	liquid	is	not	
hot),	because	it	will	get	warm	and	the	priming	
liquid will evaporate.
6.4 Flushing liquid
In	pumps	with	a	flushed	shaft	seal,	check	that	the	supply	inlet	for	
the	flushing	medium	is	open	and	that	the	flow	of	the	medium	is	
adequate	(approx.	15-30	litres/hour).Fig. 6

7. Service and maintenance
7.1 Checking the shaft seal
Check	the	pump's	shaft	seal	for	leaks	on	a	regular	basis.	If	the	shaft	
seal	is	leaking,	replace	it	or	its	relevant	parts	as	described	below.
7.2 Replacing the shaft seal
The	sectional	drawing	(page	3)	shows	the	position	and	construction	
of	the	shaft	seal	(applying	both	to	ordinary	seals	and	seals	with	
liquid/steam	flushing).
To	replace	the	shaft	seal	it	is	necessary	to	dismantle	the	pump.	
Follow	the	steps	described	below	and	refer	to	the	sectional
drawing	(page	3).
1. Disconnect	the	power	supply	in	the	motor	isolator	by	removing	
the	fuses	and	disconnecting	the	cables.
2. Turn	off	the	steam	and	flushing	liquid	supply.
3. Close	the	pump	suction	and	discharge	point	and	drain	the	pump	
housing.	If	the	pump	is	used	for	hot	and/or	aggressive	liquids,	
special	precautions	must	be	taken.	In	such	cases,	observe	the	
local	regulations	for	personal	protection	when	working	with	these	
products.
4. Open	the	clamp	ring	(item	9a)	or	the	housing	screws	once	the	inlet	
and outlet pipes have been properly isolated.  
Dismantle	the	pump	housing	(item	1a,	1b)	and	remove	the	impeller	
(item	4).
5. Take	the	stationary	seal	face	(item	5.6)	installed	in	the	back	plate	
(item	7a,	7b)	out	with	your	fingers.
6. Remove	the	o-ring	(item	5.5)	from	the	stationary	seal	face.
7. Use	your	fingers	to	remove	the	rotary	seal	face	(item	5.7)	fitted	in	
the	impeller	(item	4).
8. Remove	the	o-ring	(item	5.5)	from	the	rotary	seal	face.
9. Clean	the	chambers	of	the	stationary	and	rotary	seal	face	with	air	
or water.
9a	 The	rear	stationary	seal	face	(item	5.6)	is	mounted	on 	the	pressure	
ring*	(item	5.11).	 The	rotary	seal	face	(item	5.7)	is	mounted	on	the	
shaft	(item	11).	 These	are	removed	in	the	same	way	as	the	front	
seal	components.

11. Check	the	stationary	ring	(item	5.6)	and	rotary	ring	(item	5.7)	for	
signs	of	wear.	Wear	surfaces	must	be	completely	free	of	cracks.	If	
this	is	not	the	case,	both	the	stationary	ring	and	the	rotary	ring	must	
be	replaced.
11a	In	the	case	of	water-flushed	shaft	seals	and	aseptic	shaft	seals,	
check	the	rear	seal	rings	(item	5.6,	5.7)	for	wear,	and	replace	if	
necessary.
12. Fit	the	new	o-rings	on	the	stationary	seal	face	and	rotary	seal	face.
Caution! Remember to moisten these with water.
13. Fit	the	rotary	seal	face	on	the	impeller	without	using	tools.
Note! The	notch	in	the	rotary	seal	face	must	be	installed	
so	that	it	fits	with	the	driving	pin	(item	5.8)	in	the	
impeller hub.
13a	In	the	case	of	double	mechanical	shaft	seals,	also	fit	a 	rotary	seal	
face	(item	5.7)	with	o-ring	(item	5.5)	in	the	location	on	the	shaft	–	
again without using tools.
14. Fit	the	stationary	seal	face	in	the	back	plate	without	using	tools.
Note! Install	the	stationary	seal	face	so	that	it	fits	with	
the	pin	in	the	back	plate.	Check	that	the	stationary	
seal	face	is	positioned	so	that	it	slides	back	and	
forth	easily	within	the	back	plate.

8. Technical data
8.1 Sound pressure and sound effect level
Measurements	have	been	carried	out	in	accordance	with	ISO	3743,	
Grade	2	and	ISO	3746,	Grade	3.	 Tolerance:	±3	dB.
LpA	in	dB	refers	to	the	sound	pressure	level	at	a	distance	of	one	
metre	from	the	surface	of	the	pump	at	a	height	of	1.6	m	above	floor	
level	(cf.	EC	Directive	(89/392/EEC).
LwA	indicates	the	sound	power	level.
Operating	conditions	 A,	B	and	C	are	defined	as	follows:
a) Nominal	flow	and	max.	permissible	operating	pressure
b) Nominal	flow	and	60%	operating	pressure
c) 60%	flow	and	max.	permissible	operating	pressure
The	nominal	flow	and	max.	permissible	operating	pressure	in	the	
case	of	the	W+55/60,	for	example,	are	60	m³/hr	at	an	operating	
pressure	of	5.5	bar,	and	so	on.
This	information	only	applies	if	the	motor	used	is	an	 ABB	aluminium	
motor	and	the	size	of	the	motor	matches	the	power	requirement	of	
the pump.
The	noise	level	may	increase	considerably	if	reducers	(reduction/
expansion	fittings)	are	mounted	on	the	inlet/outlet.
The	values	shown	apply	when	the	pumps	operate	at	2900	rpm	and	
there	is	a	shroud	over	the	motor.	If	the	pumps	operate	at	1450	rpm,	
the	values	are	reduced	by	approx.	20	dB.	 The	values	for	the	
W+25/210 apply at 1450 rpm.

The manufacturing industry places heavy demand on pumps, when it comes to 
optimum operation, high reliability and low energy consumption. Therefore, 
Grundfos has developed the Pump handbook, which in a simple manner deals 
with various considerations when dimensioning pumps and pump systems. 
We have elaborated a handbook for engineers and technicians who work with 
design and installation of pumps and pump systems, containing answers to a 
wide range of technical pump speciﬁc questions. The Pump handbook can either 
be read from one end to the other or partly on speciﬁc topics.
The handbook is divided into 5 chapters which deal with different phases when 
designing pump systems. 
Throughout chapter 1 we make a general presentation of different pump types 
and components. Here we also describe which precautions to adopt when dealing 
with viscous liquids. Further, the most used materials as well as different types of 
corrosion are presented here. The most important terminologies in connection 
with reading the pump performance are presented in chapter 2. Chapter 3 deals 
with system hydraulics and some of the most important factors to consider to obtain 
optimum operation of the pump system. As it is often necessary to adjust the pump 
performance by means of different adjustment methods, these are dealt with in 
chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes the life cycle costs as energy consumption plays an 
important role in today’s pumps and pump systems.
We sincerely hope that you will make use of The pump handbook and ﬁnd it useful in 
your daily work.

Pump construction
1.1.1 The centrifugal pump
In 1689 the physicist Denis Papin invented the centrifugal 
pump and today this kind of pump is the most used around 
the world. The centrifugal pump is built on a simple 
principle: Liquid is led to the impeller hub and by means 
of the centrifugal force it is flung towards the periphery of 
the impellers. 
The construction is fairly inexpensive, robust and simple 
and its high speed makes it possible to connect the pump 
directly to an asynchronous motor. The centrifugal pump 
provides a steady liquid flow, and it can easily be throttled 
without causing any damage to the pump. 
Now let us have a look at figure 1.1.1, which shows the 
liquid’s flow through the pump. The inlet of the pump 
leads the liquid to the centre of the rotating impeller from 
where it is flung towards the periphery. This construction 
gives a high efficiency, and is suitable for handling pure 
liquids. Pumps, which have to handle impure liquids, such 
as wastewater pumps, are fitted with an impeller that is 
constructed especially to avoid that objects get stocked 
inside the pump, see section 1.2.5.
If a pressure difference occurs in the system while the 
centrifugal pump is not running, liquid can still pass 
through it due to its open design. 
As you can tell from figure 1.1.2, the centrifugal pump can 
be categorised in different groups: Radial flow pumps, 
mixed flow pumps and axial flow pumps.  Radial flow 
pumps and mixed flow pumps are the most common 
types used. Therefore, we will only concentrate on these 
types of pumps on the following pages.
However, we will briefly present the positive displacement 
pump in section 1.2.8.
The different demands on the centrifugal pump’s 
performance, especially with regards to head, flow, and 
installation, together with the demands for economical 
operation, are only a few of the reasons why so many types 
of pump exist. Figure 1.1.3 shows the different pump types 
with regard to flow and pressure.Fig. 1.1.2: Different kinds of centrifugal pumpsFig. 1.1.1: The liquid’s flow through the pump

Before we dig any further into the world of pump 
construction and pump types, we will present the 
basic characteristics of pump performance curves. The 
performance of a centrifugal pump is shown by a set 
of performance curves. The performance curves for a 
centrifugal pump are shown in figure 1.1.4. Head, power 
consumption, efficiency and NPSH are shown as a function 
of the flow.
Normally, pump curves in data booklets only cover the 
pump part. Therefore, the power consumption, the P2-
value, which is listed in the data booklets as well, only 
covers the power going into the pump – see figure 1.1.4. 
The same goes for the efficiency value, which only covers 
the pump part ( η = ηP).
In some pump types with integrated motor and possibly 
integrated frequency converter, e.g. canned motor pumps 
(see section 1.2.3), the power consumption curve and the 
η-curve cover both the motor and the pump. In this case it 
is the P1-value that has to be taken into account.
In general, pump curves are designed according to ISO 
9906 Annex A, which specifies the tolerances of the 
curves: 
• Q +/- 9%, 
• H  +/-7%, 
• P +9% 
•  -7%.
What follows is a brief presentation of the different pump 
performance curves.
Head, the QH-curve
The QH-curve shows the head, which the pump is able 
to perform at a given flow. Head is measured in meter 
liquid column [mLC]; normally the unit meter [m] is 
applied. The advantage of using the unit [m] as the unit 
of measurement for a pump’s head is that the QH-curve is 
not affected by the type of liquid the pump has to handle,
see section 2.2 for more information. H

e1844a68-3575-4ee0-bb47-3bd3d139a0ba,"Efficiency, the η-curve
The efficiency is the relation between the supplied power 
and the utilised amount of power. In the world of pumps, 
the efficiency ηP is the relation between the power, which 
the pump delivers to the water (PH) and the power input 
to the shaft (P2 ): 
where:
ρ is the density of the liquid in kg/m3, 
g is the acceleration of gravity in m/s2, 
Q is the flow in m3/s and H is the head in m. 
For water at 20oC and with Q measured in m3/h and H in m, 
the hydraulic power can be calculated as :
As it appears from the efficiency curve, the efficiency depends 
on the duty point of the pump. Therefore, it is important to 
select a pump, which fits the flow requirements and ensures 
that the pump is working in the most efficient flow area.
 
Power consumption, the P2-curve
The relation between the power consumption of the pump 
and the flow is shown in figure 1.1.8. The P2-curve of most 
centrifugal pumps is similar to the one in figure 1.1.8 where 
the P2 value increases when the flow increases.
NPSH-curve (Net Positive Suction Head)
The NPSH-value of a pump is the minimum absolute 
pressure (see section 2.2.1) that has to be present at the 
suction side of the pump to avoid cavitation. 
The NPSH-value is measured in [m] and depends on the 
flow; when the flow increases, the NPSH-value increases 
as well; figure 1.1.9. For more information concerning 
cavitation and NPSH, go to section 2.2.1.50607080

centrifugal pump
The centrifugal pump has several characteristics and in 
this section, we will present the most important ones.
Later on in this chapter we will give a more thorough 
description of the different pump types. 
• The number of stages
Depending on the number of impellers in the pump, a 
centrifugal pump can be either a single-stage pump or a 
multistage pump.
• The position of the pump shaft
Single-stage and multistage pumps come with horizontal 
or vertical pump shafts. These pumps are normally 
designated horizontal or vertical pumps. For more 
information, go to section 1.1.4.
• Single-suction or double-suction impellers
Depending on the construction of the impeller, a pump can 
be fitted with either a single-suction impeller or a double-
suction impeller. For more information, go to section 1.1.5.
• Coupling of stages
The pump stages can be arranged in two different ways: in 
series and in parallel, see figure 1.1.10.
• Construction of the pump casing
We distinguish between two types of pump casing: Volute 
casing and return channel casing with guide vanes. For 
more information, go to section 1.1.6.

End-suction pump = The liquid runs directly into the impeller. Inlet and outlet have a 
  90° angle. See section 1.1.9
In-line pump = The liquid runs directly through the pump in-line. The suction pipe and the discharge 
  pipe are placed opposite one another and can be mounted directly in the piping system
Split-case pump = Pump with an axially divided pump housing. See section 1.2.2
Horizontal pump = Pump with a horizontal pump shaft
Vertical pump = Pump with a vertical pump shaft
Single-stage pump = Pump with a single impeller. See section 1.1.7
Multistage pump = Pump with several series-coupled stages. See section 1.1.8
Long-coupled pump = Pump connected to the motor by means of a flexible coupling. The motor and 
  the pump have separate bearing constructions. See section 1.1.9
Close-coupled pump = A pump connected to the motor by means of a rigid coupling. See section 1.1.9

81c0bc81-fd87-4937-948a-4b5d52fe6eb8,"141.1.5 Impeller types (axial forces)
A centrifugal pump generates pressure that exerts forces 
on both stationary and rotating parts of the pump. 
Pump parts are made to withstand these forces. 
If axial and radial forces are not counterbalanced in the 
pump, the forces have to be taken into consideration when 
selecting the driving system for the pump (angular contact 
bearings in the motor). In pumps fitted with single-suction 
impeller, large axial forces may occur, figures 1.1.11 and 
1.1.12. These forces are balanced in one of the following 
ways:
• Mechanically by means of thrust bearings. These types  
 of bearings are specially designed to absorb the axial   
 forces from the impellers
• By means of balancing holes on the impeller,  
 see figure 1.1.13
• By means of throttle regulation from a seal ring 
 mounted on the back of the impellers, see figure 1.1.14
• Dynamic impact from the back of the impeller, see 
 figure 1.1.15
• The axial impact on the pump can be avoided by either
   using double-suction impellers (see figure 1.1.16). Fig. 1.1.11: Single-suction 
impeller

7faf32f8-fa0a-4664-94ae-79a743c44a76,"1.1.6 Casing types (radial forces)
Radial forces are a result of the static pressure in the 
casing. Therefore, axial deflections may occur and lead 
to interference between the impeller and the casing. The 
magnitude and the direction of the radial force depend on 
the flow rate and the head.
When designing the casing for the pump, it is possible 
to control the hydraulic radial forces. Two casing types 
are worth mentioning: the single-volute casing and the 
double-volute casing. As you can tell from figure 1.1.18, 
both casings are shaped as a volute. The difference between 
them is, that the double-volute has an guide vane. 
The single-volute pump is characterised by a symmetric 
pressure in the volute at the optimum efficiency point, 
which leads to zero radial load. At all other points, 
the pressure around the impeller is not regular and 
consequently a radial force is present. 
As you can tell from figure 1.1.19, the double-volute casing 
develops a constant low radial reaction force at any capacity.
Return channels (figure 1.1.20) are used in multistage pumps 
and have the same basic function as volute casings. The 
liquid is led from one impeller to the next and at the same 
time, the rotation of water is reduced and the dynamic 
pressure is transformed into static pessure. Because of the 
return channel casing’s circular design, no radial forces are 
present.  
1.1.7 Single-stage pumps
Generally, single-stage pumps are used in applications, 
which do not require a total head of more than 150 m. 
Normally, single-stage pumps operate in the interval of 
2-100 m.
Single-stage pumps are characterised by providing a low 
head relative to the flow, see figure 1.1.3. The single-stage 
pump comes in both a vertical and a horizontal design, see 
figures 1.1.21 and 1.1.22.

Fig. 1.1.26: Long-coupled pump with spacer coupling   
161.1.8 Multistage pumps
Multistage pumps are used in installations where a high 
head is needed. Several stages are connected in series and 
the flow is guided from the outlet of one stage to the inlet 
of the next. The final head that a multistage pump can 
deliver is equal to the sum of pressure each of the stages 
can provide.
The advantage of multistage pumps is that they provide 
high head relative to the flow. Like the single-stage pump, 
the multistage pump is available in both a vertical and a  
horizontal version, see figures 1.1.23 and 1.1.24.
1.1.9 Long-coupled and close-coupled 
pumps
Long-coupled pumps
Long-coupled pumps are pumps with a flexible coupling 
that connects the pump and the motor. This kind of 
coupling is available either as a basic coupling or as a 
spacer coupling.
If the pump is connected to the motor by a basic coupling, 
it is necessary to dismount the motor when the pump 
needs service. Therefore, it is necessary to align the pump 
upon mounting, see figure 1.1.25.
On the other hand, if the pump is fitted with a spacer 
coupling, it is possible to service the pump without 
dismounting the motor. Alignment is thus not an issue, 
see figure 1.1.26.
Close-coupled pumps
Close-coupled pumps can be constructed in the following 
two ways: Either the pump has the impeller mounted 
directly on the extended motor shaft or the pump has a  
standard motor and a rigid or a spacer coupling, see figures 
1.1.27 and 1.1.28.  Fig. 1.1.24: Horizontal multistage

1.2.1 Standard pumps
Few international standards deal with centrifugal pumps. 
In fact, many countries have their own standards, which 
more or less overlap one another. A standard pump is 
a pump that complies with official regulations as to for 
example the pump’s duty point. What follows, are a couple 
of examples of international standards for pumps:
• EN 733 (DIN 24255) applies to end-suction centrifugal   
 pumps, also known as standard water pumps with a   
 rated pressure (PN) of 10 bar.
 
• EN 22858 (ISO 2858) applies to centrifugal pumps, also
  known as standard chemical pumps with a rated   
 pressure (PN) of 16 bar, see appendix K.
The standards mentioned above cover the installation 
dimensions and the duty points of the different pump 
types. As to the hydraulic parts of these pump types, they 
vary according to the manufacturer – thus, no international 
standards are set for these parts.
Pumps, which are designed according to standards, provide  
the end-user with advantages with regard to service, spare 
parts and maintenance. 
1.2.2 Split-case pumps
A split-case pump is a pump with the pump housing 
divided axially into two parts. Figure 1.2.4 shows a single-
stage split-case pump with a double-suction impeller. 
The double-inlet construction eliminates the axial 
forces and ensures a longer life span of the bearings. 
Usually, split-case pumps have a rather high efficiency, 
are easy to service and have a wide performance range. Section 1.2

181.2.3 Hermetically sealed pumps
It comes as no surprise that a pump’s shaft lead-in has to be 
sealed. Usually, this is done by means of a mechanical shaft 
seal, see figure 1.2.5. The disadvantage of the mechanical 
shaft seal is its poor properties when it comes to handling 
of toxic and aggressive liquids, which consequently leads 
to leakage. These problems can to some extent be solved 
by using a double mechanical shaft seal. Another solution 
to these problems is to use a hermetically sealed pump. 
We distinguish between two types of hermetically sealed 
pumps: Canned motor pumps and magnetic-driven pumps. 
In the following two sections, you can find additional 
information about these pumps.
Canned motor pumps 
A canned motor pump is a hermetically sealed pump with 
the motor and pump integrated in one unit without a seal, 
see figures 1.2.6 and 1.2.7. The pumped liquid is allowed to 
enter the rotor chamber that is separated from the stator 
by a thin rotor can. The rotor can serves as a hermetically 
sealed barrier between the liquid and the motor. Chemical 
pumps are made of materials, e.g. plastics or stainless 
steel that can withstand aggressive liquids.   
The most common canned motor pump type is the 
circulator pump. This type of pump is typically used in 
heating circuits because the construction provides low 
noise and maintenance-free operation.

In recent years, magnetic-driven pumps have become 
increasingly popular for transferring aggressive and toxic 
liquids. 
As shown in figure 1.2.8, the magnetic-driven pump is 
made of two groups of magnets; an inner magnet and 
an outer magnet. A non-magnetizable can separate these 
two groups. The can serves as a hermetically sealed barrier 
between the liquid and the atmosphere. As it appears 
from figure 1.2.9, the outer magnet is connected to the 
pump drive and the inner magnet is connected to the 
pump shaft. Hereby the torque from the pump drive is 
transmitted to the pump shaft. The pumped liquid serves 
as lubricant for the bearings in the pump. Therefore, 
sufficient venting is crucial for the bearings.

Sanitary pumps are mainly used in the food, beverage, 
pharmaceutical and bio-technological industries where it 
is important that the pumped liquid is handled in a gentle 
manner and that the pumps are easy to clean.
In order to meet process requirements in these industries, 
the pumps have to have a surface roughness between 
3.2 and 0.4 µm Ra.  This can be best achieved by using 
forged or deep-drawn rolled stainless steel as materials 
of construction, see figure 1.2.12 . These materials have a 
compact pore-free surface finish that can be easily worked 
up to meet the various surface finish requirements.
The main features of a sanitary pump are ease of cleaning 
and ease of maintenance.
The leading manufacturers of sanitary pumps have 
designed their products to meet the following standards:

68773d7a-9b64-465a-a6d1-0cf03f436700,"1.2.5 Wastewater pumps
A wastewater pump is an enclosed unit with a pump 
and a motor. Due to this construction the wastewater 
pump is suitable for submersible installation in pits. 
In submersible installations with auto-coupling systems 
double rails are normally used. The auto-coupling system 
facilitates maintenance, repair and replacement of the 
pump. Because of the construction of the pump, it is 
not necessary to enter the pit to carry out service. In 
fact, it is possible to connect and disconnect the pump 
automatically from the outside of the pit. Wastewater 
pumps can also be installed dry like conventional pumps 
in vertical or horizontal installations. Likewise this type of 
installation provides easy maintenance and repair like it 
provides uninterrupted operation of the pump in case of 
flooding of the dry pit, see figure 1.2.14. 
Normally, wastewater pumps have to be able to handle large 
particles. Therefore they are fitted with special  impellers that 
make it possible to avoid blockage and clogging. Different 
types of impellers exist; single-channel impellers, double-
channel impellers three and four-channel impellers and 
vortex impellers. Figure 1.2.15 shows the different designs of 
these impellers.
Wastewater pumps usually come with a dry motor, which 
is IP68 protected (for more information on IP-classes,

extended shaft with a double mechanical shaft seal system 
in an intermediate oil chamber, see figure 1.2.13.
Wastewater pumps are able to operate either intermittently

An immersible pump is a pump type where the pump part 
is immersed in the pumped liquid and the motor is kept 
dry. Normally, immersible pumps are mounted on top of 
or in the wall of tanks or containers. Immersible pumps 
are for example used in the machine tool industry  for 
example in spark machine tools, grinding machines, 
machining  centres and cooling units or in other industrial 
applications involving tanks or containers, such as 
industrial washing and filtering systems.
Pumps for machine tools can be divided in two groups: 
Pumps for the clean side of the filter and pumps for the 
dirty side of the filter. Pumps with closed impellers are 
normally used for the clean side of the filter, because they 
provide a high efficiency and a high pressure if necessary. 
Pumps with open or semi-open impellers are normally 
used for the dirty side of the filter, because they can 
handle metal chips and particles.

05c8bdc4-b858-46c9-8428-463dd9ac3068,"1.2.7 Borehole pumps
Two types of borehole pumps exist: The submerged 
borehole pump type with a submersible motor, and the 
deep well pump with a dry motor, which is connected 
to the pump by a long shaft. These pumps are normally 
used in connection with water supply and irrigation. Both  
pump types are made to be installed in deep and narrow 
boreholes and have thus a reduced diameter, which makes 
them longer than other pump types, see figure 1.2.17.
The borehole pumps are specially designed to be 
submerged in a liquid and are thus fitted with a 
submersible motor, which is IP68 protected. The pump 
comes in both a single-stage and a multistage version (the 
multistage version being the most common one), and is 
fitted with a non-return valve in the pump head. 
Today, the deep well pump has been more or less replaced 
by the submerged pump type. The long shaft of the deep 
well pump is a drawback, which makes it difficult to 
install and carry out service. Because the deep well pump 
motor is air-cooled, the pump is often used in industrial 
applications to pump hot water from open tanks. The 
submersible pump cannot handle as high temperatures 
because the motor is submerged in the liquid, which has 
to cool it.

43f726bc-ab57-4261-9d81-4a3ad381be9f,"1.2.8 Positive displacement pumps
The positive displacement pump provides an approximate 
constant flow at fixed speed, despite changes in the 
counterpressure. Two main types of positive displacement 
pumps exist:
• Rotary pumps
• Reciprocating pumps
The difference in performance between a centrifugal 
pump, a rotary pump and a reciprocating is illustrated 
to the right, figure 1.2.18.  Depending on which of these 
pumps you are dealing with, a small change in the pump’s 
counterpressure results in differences in the flow.
The flow of a centrifugal pump will change considerably, 
the flow of a rotary pump will change a little, while the  
flow of a reciprocating pump will hardly change at all. 
But, why is there a difference between the pump curves 
for reciprocating pumps and rotary pumps? The actual 
seal face surface is larger for rotary pumps than for 
reciprocating pumps. So, even though the two pumps are 
designed with the same tolerances, the gap loss of the 
rotary pump is larger. The pumps are  typically designed with the finest tolerances 
possible to obtain the highest possible efficiency and 
suction capability. However, in some cases, it is necessary 
to increase the tolerances, for example when the pumps 
have to handle highly viscous liquids, liquids containing 
particles and liquids of high temperature.   
Positive displacement pumps are pulsate, meaning that 
their volume flow within a cycle is not constant.
The variation in flow and speed leads to pressure fluctuations 
due to resistance in the pipe system and in valves. QH

8bdaffd9-56d2-4a23-9ea4-b7940c9708a3,"+Dosing pumps
The dosing pump belongs to the positive displacement 
pump family and is typically of the  diaphragm type. Diaphragm 
pumps are leakage-free, because the diaphragm forms 
a seal between the liquid and the surroundings. 
The diaphragm pump is fitted with two non-return valves 
– one on the suction side and one on the discharge side 
of the pump. In connection with smaller diaphragm pumps, 
the diaphragm is activated by the connecting rod, which is 
connected to an electromagnet. Thereby the coil receives 
the exact amount of strokes needed, see figure 1.2.21.
In connection with larger diaphragm pumps the 
diaphragm is typically mounted on the connecting  rod, 
which is activated by a camshaft.  The camshaft is turned by 
means of a standard asynchronous motor, see figure 1.2.22.
The flow of a diaphragm pump is adjusted by either 
changing the stroke length and/or the frequency of the 
strokes. If it is necessary to enlarge the operating area, 
frequency converters can be connected to the larger 
diaphragm pumps, see figure 1.2.22.
Yet, another kind of diaphragm pump exists. In this case, 
the diaphragm is activated by means of an excentrically 
driven connecting rod powered by a stepper motor or a 
synchronous motor, figures 1.2.20 and 1.2.23. By using a 
stepper motor drive the pump’s dynamic area is increased 
and its accuracy is improved considerably. With this 
construction  it is no longer necessary to adjust the pump’s 
stroke length because the connection rod is mounted 
directly on the diaphragm. The result is optimised suction 
conditions and excellent operation features.
So therefore, it is simple to control both the suction 
side and the discharge side of the pump.  Compared to 
traditional electromagnetic-driven diaphragm pumps 
which provide powerful pulsations, stepper motor-driven 
diaphragm pumps make it possible to get a much more 
steady dosage of additive.

Mechanical shaft seals
From the middle of the 1950s mechanical shaft seals 
gained ground in favour of the traditional sealing method 
- the stuffing box. Compared to stuffing boxes, mechani -
cal shaft seals provide the following advantages: 
• They keep tight at smaller displacements and vibrations  
 in the shaft
• They do not require any adjustment
• Seal faces provide a small amount of friction and thus,   
 minimise the power loss
• The shaft does not slide against any of the seal’s   
 components and thus, is not damaged because of 
 wear (reduced repair costs).
The mechanical shaft seal is the part of a pump that 
separates the liquid from the atmosphere. In figure 1.3.1 
you can see a couple of examples where the mechanical 
shaft seal is mounted in different types of  pumps.
The majority of mechanical shaft seals are made 
according to the European standard EN 12756. 
Before choosing a shaft seal, there are certain things 
you need to know about the liquid and thus the 
seal’s resistance to the liquid:
• Determine the type of liquid 
• Determine the pressure that the shaft seal is exposed to
• Determine the speed that the shaft seal is exposed to
• Determine the built-in dimensions
On the following pages we will present how a mechanical shaft 
seal works, the different types of seal, which kind of materials 
mechanical shaft seals are made of and which factors that 
affect the mechanical shaft seal’s performance.

components and function
The mechanical shaft seal is made of two main components: 
a rotating part and a stationary part; and consists of the parts 
listed in figure 1.3.2. Figure 1.3.3 shows where the different 
parts are placed in the seal.
• The stationary part of the seal is fixed in the pump   
    housing. The rotating part of the seal is fixed on the   
    pump shaft and rotates when the pump operates.
• The two primary seal faces are pushed against each other   
 by the spring and the liquid pressure. During operation   
 a liquid film is produced in the narrow gap between the 
 two seal faces. This film evaporates before it enters the   
 atmosphere, making the mechanical shaft seal liquid tight,
 see figure 1.3.4.
• Secondary seals prevent leakage from occurring    
 between the assembly and the shaft.
• The spring presses the seal faces together mechanically.
• The spring retainer transmits torque from the shaft to   
 the seal. In connection with mechanical bellows shaft   
 seals, torque is transferred directly through the bellows. 
   
Seal gap
During operation the liquid forms a lubricating film 
between the seal faces. This lubricating film consists of a 
hydrostatic and a hydrodynamic film.
• The hydrostatic element is generated by the pumped  
 liquid which is forced into the gap between the seal faces.
• The hydrodynamic lubricating film is created by    
 pressure generated by the shaft’s rotation. Fig. 1.3.4: Mechanical shaft seal in operationLubrication film

779ae774-b669-4c15-ae1b-65a37102e434,"1.3.2 Balanced and unbalanced shaft seals
To obtain an acceptable face pressure between the 
primary seal faces, two kind of seal types exist: a balanced  
shaft seal and an unbalanced shaft seal.
Balanced shaft seal
Figure 1.3.6 shows a balanced shaft seal indicating where 
the forces interact on the seal. 
Unbalanced shaft seal
Figure 1.3.7 shows an unbalanced shaft seal indicating 
where the forces interact on the seal.
 
Several different forces have an axial impact on the seal 
faces. The spring force and the hydraulic force from the 
pumped liquid press the seal together while the force from 
the lubricating film in the seal gap counteracts this. In 
connection with high liquid pressure, the hydraulic forces 
can be so powerful that the lubricant in the seal gap cannot 
counteract the contact between the seal faces. Because the 
hydraulic force is proportionate to the area that the liquid 
pressure affects, the axial impact can only be reduced by 
obtaining a reduction of the pressure-loaded area.The thickness of the lubricating film depends on the pump 
speed, the liquid temperature, the viscosity of the liquid 
and the axial forces of the mechanical shaft seal. The 
liquid is continuously changed in the seal gap because of 
• evaporation of the liquid to the atmosphere
• the liquid’s circular movement
Figure 1.3.5 shows the optimum ratio between fine 
lubrication properties and limited leakage.  As you can tell, 
the optimum ratio is when the lubricating film covers the 
entire seal gap, except for a very narrow evaporation zone 
close to the atmospheric side of the mechanical shaft seal. 
Leakage due to deposits on the seal faces is often observed. 
When using coolant agents, deposits are built up quickly by 
the evaporation at the atmosphere side of the seal. When 
the liquid evaporates in the evaporation zone, microscopic 
solids  in the liquid remain in the seal gap as deposits  
creating wear. 
These deposits are seen in connection with most types 
of liquid. But when the pumped liquid has a tendency 
to crystallise, it can become a problem. The best way to 
prevent wear is to select seal faces made of hard material, 
such as tungsten carbide (WC) or silicon carbide (SiC). 
The narrow seal gap between these materials (app. 0.3 µm 
Ra) minimises the risk of solids entering the seal gap and 
thereby minimises the amount of deposits building up. Pressur e

as the ratio between the area A and the area (B) : K=A/B
K = Balancing ratio
A = Area exposed to hydraulic pressure

For balanced shaft seals the balancing ratio is usually 
around K=0.8 and for unbalanced shaft seals the balancing 
ratio is normally around K=1.2.
1.3.3 Types of mechanical shaft seals
What follows is a brief outline of the main types of 
mechanical shaft seals: O-ring seal, bellows seal, and the 
one-unit seal - the cartridge seal.
O-ring seals
In an O-ring seal, sealing between the rotating shaft and
the rotating seal face is effected by an O-ring (figure 1.3.9). 
The O-ring must be able to slide freely in the axial direction 
to absorb axial displacements as a result of changes 
in temperatures and wear. Incorrect positioning of the 
stationary seat may result in rubbing and thus unnecessary 
wear on the O-ring and on the shaft. O-rings are made of 
different types of rubber material, such as NBR, EPDM and 
FKM, depending on the operating conditions.
Bellows seals
A common feature of bellows seals is a rubber or metal
bellows which functions as dynamic sealing element 
between the rotating ring and the shaft.
Rubber bellows seals
The bellows of a rubber bellows seal (see figure 1.3.10) can 
be made of different types of rubber material, such as NBR,
EPDM and FKM, depending on the operating conditions.
Two different geometric principles are used for the
design of rubber bellows:
• Folding bellows
• Rolling bellows.Fig. 1.3.8: Wear rate for different balancing ratiosTemper ature (oC)0 20 40 60 8 0 100 120 140Wear ra te co mpar ativ e

In an ordinary mechanical shaft seal, the spring produces 
the closing force required to close the seal faces. In a 
metal bellows seal (figure 1.3.11) the spring has been 
replaced by a metal bellows with a similar force. 
Metal bellows act both as a dynamic seal between the 
rotating ring and the shaft and as a spring. The bellows 
have a number of corrugations to give them the desired 
spring force.
Cartridge seals
In a cartridge mechanical shaft seal, all parts form a compact 
unit on a shaft sleeve, ready to be installed. A cartridge seal 
offers many benefits compared to conventional mechanical 
shaft seals, figure 1.3.12.
Flushing
In certain applications it is possible to extend the 
performance of the mechanical shaft seal by installing 
flushing, see figure 1.3.13. Flushing can lower the 
temperature of the mechanical shaft seal and prevent 
deposits from occurring. Flushing can be installed either 
internally or externally. Internal flushing is done when a 
small flow from the pump’s discharge side is bypassed 
to the seal area. Internal flushing is primarily used to 
prevent further heat generation from the seal in heating 
applications. External flushing is done by a flushing liquid 
and is used to ensure trouble-free operation when handling 
liquids that are abrasive or contain clogging solids.Fig. 1.3.11: Cartridge metal

b196c041-476c-4b65-863a-7ad8e380171e,"33Double mechanical shaft seals
Double mechanical shaft seals are used when the life 
span of single mechanical shaft seals is insufficient due 
to wear caused by solids or too high/low pressure and 
temperature. Further, double mechanical shaft seals are 
used in connection with toxic, aggressive and explosive liquids 
to protect the surroundings. Two types of double mechanical 
shaft seals exist: The double seal in a tandem arrangement 
and the double seal in a back-to-back arrangement.
Double seal in tandem
This type of double seal consists of two mechanical shaft 
seals mounted in tandem, that is one behind the other, 
placed in a separate seal chamber, see figure 1.3.14.
The seal type is used when a pressurised double mechanical 
shaft seal mounted in a back-to-back arrangement is not 
necessary.
 
The tandem seal arrangement has to be fitted with a 
quenching liquid system which 
 
• absorbs leakage
• monitors the leakage rate
• lubricates and cools the outboard seal to prevent icing
• protects against dry-running 
• stabilises the lubricating film
• prevents air from entering the pump in case of vacuum
The pressure of the quenching liquid must always be lower 
than the pumped liquid pressure.
Tandem - circulation
Circulation of quenching liquid via a pressureless tank, see 
figure 1.3.14. Quenching liquid from the elevated tank is 
circulated by thermosiphon action and/or by pumping action 
in the seal.  
Tandem - dead end
Quenching liquid from an elevated tank, see figure 1.3.15. No 
heat is dissipated from the system.
Tandem - drain
The quenching liquid runs directly through the seal chamber 
to be collected for reuse, or directed to drain, see figure 1.3.16.Fig. 1.3.16: Tandem seal arrangement with quench liquid to drain••

3761df34-1dc8-4a04-aa29-0c3d66fd924d,"341.3.4 Seal face material combinations
What follows is a description of the most important 
material pairings used in mechanical shaft seals for 
industrial applications: Tungsten carbide/tungsten 
carbide, silicon carbide/silicon carbide and carbon/
tungsten carbide or carbon/silicon carbide.
Tungsten carbide/tungsten carbide  
(WC/WC)
Cemented tungsten carbide covers the type of hard metals 
that are based on a hard tungsten carbide (WC) phase and 
usually a softer metallic binder phase. The correct technical 
term is cemented tungsten carbide, however, the abbreviated 
term tungsten carbide (WC) is used for convenience. 
Cobalt-bonded (Co) WC is only corrosion resistant in water if 
the pump incorporates base metal, such as cast iron. 
Chromium-nickel-molybdenum-bounded WC has a 
corrosion resistance equal to EN 14401.
Sintered binderless WC has the highest corrosion 
resistance. However, its resistance to corrosion in liquids, 
such as hypochlorite, is not as high. The material pairing 
WC/WC has the following features:
• Extremely wear resistant
• Very robust, resists rough handling
• Poor dry-running properties. In case of dry-running, the   
 temperature increases to several hundred degrees Celsius   
 in very few minutes and consequently damages the O-rings.
If a certain pressure and a certain temperature are 
exceeded, the seal may generate noise. Noise is an 
indication of poor seal operating conditions that in the 
long term may cause wear of the seal. The limits of use 
depend on seal face diameter and design.
To a WC/WC seal face pairing, the running-in wear period 
where noise is to be expected may last 3-4 weeks, although 
typically, no noise occurs during the first 3-4  days.Double seal in back-to-back
This type of seal is the optimum solution for handling
abrasive, aggressive, explosive or sticky liquids, which 
would either wear out, damage or block a mechanical 
shaft seal. 
The back-to-back double seal consists of two shaft
seals mounted back-to-back in a separate seal chamber,
see figure 1.3.17. The back-to-back double seal protects 
the surrounding environment and the people working  
with the pump.
The pressure in the seal chamber must be 1-2 bar higher 
than the pump pressure. The pressure can be generated 
by:
• An existing, separate pressure source. Many   
 applications incorporate pressurised systems.
• A separate pump, e.g. a dosing pump.•

911f6b26-db45-4cbd-a8bb-64aea1ca68be,"Silicon carbide/silicon carbide
(SiC/SiC)
Silicon carbide/silicon carbide (SiC/SiC) is an alternative to 
WC/WC and is used where higher corrosion resistance is 
required .
The SiC/SiC material pairing has the following features:
• Very brittle material requiring careful handling
• Extremely wear resistant
• Extremely good corrosion resistance. SiC (Q 1s, Q 1P and  
 Q 1G ) hardly corrodes, irrespective of the pumped liquid 
 type. However, an exception is water with very poor  
 conductivity, such as demineralised water, which attacks 
 the SiC variants Q 1s and Q 1P, whereas Q 1G is corrosion-  
 resistant also in this liquid
• In general, these material pairings have poor dry-running   
 properties however, the Q 1G / Q 1G material withstands a 
 limited period of dry-running on account of the
  graphite content of the material
For different purposes, various SiC/SiC variants exist: 
Q 1s, dense-sintered, fine-grained SiC
A direct-sintered, fine-grained SiC with a small amount of 
tiny pores. 
For a number of years, this SiC variant was used as a 
standard mechanical shaft seal material. Pressure and 
temperature limits are slightly below those of WC/WC.
  Q 1P, porous, sintered, fine-grained SiC
A variant of the dense-sintered SiC. This SiC variant has 
large circular closed pores. The degree of porosity is 5-15% 
and the size of the pores 10-50 µm Ra.   
The pressure and temperature limits exceed those of WC/WC.
35Consequently, in warm water, the Q 1P / Q 1P face material 
pairing generates less noise than the WC/WC pairing. 
However, noise from porous SiC seals must be expected 
during the running-in wear period of 3-4 days.
Q 1G self-lubricating, sintered SiC
Several variants of SiC materials containing dry lubricants 
are available on the market. The designation Q1G applies 
to a SiC material, which is suitable for use in distilled or 
demineralised water, as opposed to the above materials.
Pressure and temperature limits of Q 1G / Q 1G are similar to 
those of Q 1P / Q 1P.
The dry lubricants, i.e. graphite, reduce the friction in case 
of dry-running, which is of decisive importance to the 
durability of a seal during dry-running. 
Carbon/tungsten carbide or carbon/
silicon carbide features
Seals with one carbon seal face have the following 
features:
• Brittle material requiring careful handling
• Worn by liquids containing solid particles
• Good corrosion resistance
• Good dry-running properties (temporary dry-running)
• The self-lubricating properties of carbon make the
 seal suitable for use even with poor lubricating 
 conditions (high temperature) without generating
 noise. However, such conditions will cause wear of
  the carbon seal face leading to reduced seal life. The 
 wear depends on the pressure, temperature, liquid
  diameter and seal design. 
 Low speeds reduce the lubrication between the seal
 faces; as a result, increased wear might have been
  expected. However, this is normally not the case because 
 the distance that the seal faces have to move is reduced.
",35,Grundfosliterature-5448843.pdf
74c102fc-cdd2-4c29-b2ff-b2c6261fdf86,"36• Metal-impregnated carbon (A) offers limited corro-
 sion resistance, but improved mechanical strength, 
 heat conductivity and thus reduced wear
• With reduced mechanical strength, but higher
 corrosion resistance, synthetic resin-impregnated
 carbon (B) covers a wide application field. Synthetic 
 resin-impregnated carbon is approved for drinking
 water
             
• The use of carbon/SiC for hot water applications may
 cause heavy wear of the SiC, depending on the 
 quality of the carbon and water. This type of wear
 primarily applies to Q 1S/carbon. The use of Q 1P, 
 Q 1G or a carbon/WC pairing causes far less wear. Thus, 
 carbon/WC, carbon/Q 1P or carbon/Q 1G are recommended
 for hot water systems 
1.3.5 Factors affecting the seal 
performance
As mentioned previously, no seal is completely tight. On 
the next pages, we will present the following factors, 
which have an impact on the seal performance: Energy 
consumption, noise and leakage. These factors will be 
presented individually. However, it is important to stress 
that they are closely interrelated, and thus must be 
considered as a whole.  
 
Energy consumption
It comes as no surprise that power is needed to make the 
seal rotate. The following factors contribute to the power 
consumption, that is the power loss of a mechanical shaft 
seal:• The centrifugal pumping action of the rotating parts.   
 The power consumption increases dramatically with 
 the speed of rotation (to the third power).
• The seal face friction.
  Friction between the two seal faces consists of 
 – friction in the thin liquid film and 
 – friction due to points of contact between the 
  seal faces.
The level of power consumption depends on seal design, 
lubricating conditions and seal face materials.
Figure 1.3.18 is a typical example of the power consumption 
of a mechanical shaft seal. The figure shows that up to 3600 
rpm friction is the major reason for the mechanical shaft 
seal’s energy consumption.

stuffing boxes, an important issue. As you can tell from 
the example, replacing a stuffing box by a mechanical 
shaft seal leads to considerable energy savings, see 
figure 1.3.19.
Noise
The choice of seal face materials is decisive for the 
function and the life of the mechanical shaft seal. Noise 
is generated as a result of the poor lubricating conditions 
in seals handling low viscosity liquids. The viscosity 
of water decreases with increasing temperature. This 
means that the lubricating conditions decrease as the 
temperature rises. If the pumped liquid reaches or 
exceeds boiling temperature, the liquid on part of the 
seal face evaporates, which results in a further decrease 
in the lubricating conditions. A speed reduction has the 
same effect, see figure 1.3.20.
Leakage
The pumped liquid lubricates the seal face of a 
mechanical shaft seal. Thus, better lubrication means 
less friction and increased leakage. Conversely, less 
leakage means worse lubricating conditions and 
increased friction. In practice, the amount of leakage 
and power loss that occur in mechanical shaft seals can 
vary. The reason is that leakage depends on factors which 
are impossible to quantify theoretically because of type 
of seal faces, type of liquid, spring load, etc. Therefore, 
figure 1.3.21 should be perceived as a guideline.
To read the leakage rate curve correctly (figure 1.3.21), 
you have to go through four steps:
Step 1 : Read the pressure  - in this case 5 bar
Step 2 : 30 mm unbalanced shaft seal

NEMA
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) 
sets standards for a wide range of electric products, including 
motors. NEMA is primarily associated with motors used in 
North America. The standards represent general industry 
practices and are supported by the manufacturers of electric 
equipment. The standards can be found in NEMA Standard 
Publication No. MG1. Some large motors may not fall under 
NEMA standards.IEC
The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) sets 
standards for motors used in many countries around the

Ex-motors
ATEX (ATmosphère EXplosible) refers to two EU directives 
about danger of explosion within different areas. The ATEX  
directive concerns electrical, mechanical, hydraulic and 
pneumatic equipment. As to the mechanical equipment, 
the safety requirements in the ATEX directive ensure that 
pump components, such as shaft seals and bearings do not 
heat up and ignite gas and dust. The ﬁrst ATEX directive 
(94/9/EC) deals with requirements put on equipment for 
use in areas with danger of explosion. The manufacturer 
has to fulﬁl the requirements and mark his products with 
categories. The second ATEX directive (99/92/EC) deals 
with the minimum safety and health requirements that 
the user has to fulﬁl, when working in areas with danger of 
explosion. Different techniques are used to prevent electric 
equipment from becoming a source of ignition. In the 
case of electric motors, protection types d (flameproof), e 
(increased safety) and nA (non-sparking) are applied 
in connection with gas, and DIP (dust ignition proof) is 
applied in connection with dust.
Flameproof motors - protection type EExd (de)  
First of all, flameproof EExd (type de) motors are category 
2G equipment for use in zone 1. The stator housing and 
the flanges enclose the flameproof motor parts that 
can ignite a potentially explosive atmosphere. Because 
of the enclosure, the motor can withstand the pressure 
that goes along with the explosion of an explosive 
mixture inside the motor. Propagation of the explosion 
to the atmosphere that surrounds the enclosure is hereby 
avoided because the explosion is cooled down by means 
of flame paths. The size of the flame paths is defined in 
the EN 50018 standard. The surface temperature of the 
flameproof enclosure should always be in accordance with 
the temperature classes.
Increased safety motors - protection type EEx (e)
Increased safety motors (type e) are category 2G equipment 
for use in zone 1. These motors are not flameproof and not 
built to withstand an internal explosion. The construction 
of such a motor is based on increased security against 5User Manuf actur er

safety motors is valid for both internal and external 
surfaces, and therefore, it is important to observe the

Non-sparking motors - protection type Ex (nA)
Non-sparking motors (type nA) are category 3G equipment 
for use in zone 2. These motors cannot by any means ignite 
a potential explosive atmosphere under normal operation, 
see figure 1.4.6.
Dust Ignition Proof (DIP)
Two types of Dust Ignition Proof motors exist: 2D/category 
2 equipment and 3D/category 3 equipment.2D/category 2 equipment
In order to avoid static electricity to cause ignition, the 
cooling fan on a category 2 DIP motor for use in zone 21 
(area with potential danger of explosion) is made of metal. 
Likewise, to minimise the risk of ignition, the external 
ground terminal is subject to more severe demands of 
construction. The external surface temperature of the 
enclosure, which is indicated on the motor nameplate and 
corresponds to the running performance during the worst 
conditions allowed for the motor. Motors for use in zone 21 
(areas with potential danger of explosion) have to be IP65 
protected, that is completely protected against dust.

equipment.
Mounting (International Mounting - IM)
Three different ways of mounting the motor exist: Foot-
mounted motor, ﬂange-mounted motor with free-hole 
ﬂange (FF) and ﬂange-mounted motor with tapped-hole 
ﬂange (FT). Figure 1.4.8 shows the different ways of 
mounting a motor and the standards that apply for the 
mountings. The mounting of motors is stated according to 
the following standards:
• IEC 60034-7, Code I, 
 i.e. designation IM followed by the previously 
 used DIN 42590 code
• IEC 60034-7,  Code II
Enclosure class 
(Ingress Protection - IP)
The enclosure class states the degrees of protection of 
the motor against ingress of solid objects and water.  
The enclosure class is stated by means of two letters IP 
followed by two digits, for example IP55. The first digit 
stands for protection against contact and ingress of solid 
objects and the second digit stands for protection against 
ingress of water, see figure 1.4.9.
Drain holes enable the escape of water which has entered 
the stator housing for instance through condensation. 
When the motor is installed in a damp environment, the 
bottom drain hole should be opened. Opening the drain 
hole changes the motor’s enclosure class from IP55 to 
IP44.IM B3

Figure 1.4.11 gives an overview of the relation between 
frame size, shaft end, motor power and flange type and 
size. For motors in frame sizes 63 up to and including 315M, 
the relationship is specified in EN 50347. For motors with 
frame size 315L and larger, no standard covers this relation. 
The figure shows where on the motor the different values 
that make up the frame size are measured. 
Flanges and shaft end comply with EN 50347 and 
IEC 60072-1. Some pumps have a coupling, which requires 
a smooth motor shaft end or a special shaft extension 
which is not defined in the standards. 
Insulation class
The insulation class is defined in the IEC 60085 standard 
and tells something about how robust the insulation 
system is to temperatures. The life of an insulation 
material is highly dependent on the temperature to which 
it is exposed. The various insulation materials and systems 
are classified into insulation classes depending on their 
ability to resist high temperatures.IEC 100L (In this case L = 140mm) 100mm

ExpensivePros Cons
Direct-on-line starting (DOL)
As the name suggests, direct-on-line starting means that 
the motor is started by connecting it directly to the supply 
at rated voltage. Direct-on-line starting is suitable for stable 
supplies and mechanically stiff and well-dimensioned 
shaft systems, for example pumps. Whenever applying 
the direct-on-line starting method, it is important to consult 
local authorities.
Star/delta starting
The objective of this starting method, which is used with 
three-phase induction motors, is to reduce the starting 
current. In one position, current supply to the stator 
windings is connected in star (Y) for starting. In other 
positions, current supply is reconnected to the windings in 
delta (∆) once the motor has gained speed.Autotransformer starting
As the name states, autotransformer starting makes use 
of an autotransformer. The autotransformer is placed in 
series with the motor during start and varies the voltage 
up to nominal voltage in two to four steps.
Soft starter
A soft starter is, as you would expect, a device which 
ensures a soft start of a motor. This is done by raising the 
voltage to a preset voltage raise time.
Frequency converter starting
Frequency converters are designed for continuous feeding 
of motors, but they can also be used for soft starting.1.4.2 Motor start-up
We distinguish between different ways of starting up 
the motor: Direct-on-line starting, star/delta starting, 
autotransformer starting, soft starter and frequency 
converter starting.  Each of these methods have their pros 
and cons, see figure 1.4.13.

Motors",46,Grundfosliterature-5448843.pdf
bb1246ef-0a88-41bc-b74e-ecba7c508b8e,"1.4.3 Voltage supply
The motor’s rated voltage lies within a certain voltage 
range. Figure 1.4.14 shows typical voltage examples for 50 
Hz and 60 Hz motors. 
According to the international standard IEC 60038, the 
motor has to be able to operate with a main voltage 
tolerance of ± 10%.
For motors that are designed according to the IEC 60034-
1 standard with a wide voltage range, e.g. 380-415 V, the 
main voltage may have a tolerance of ± 5%.
The permissible maximum temperature for the actual 
insulation class is not exceeded when the motor is 
operated within the rated voltage range. For conditions 
at the extreme boundaries the temperature typically rises 
approx. 10 Kelvin.
1.4.4 Frequency converter
Frequency converters are often used for speed controlling 
pumps, see chapter 4. The frequency converter converts 
the mains voltage into a new voltage and frequency, 
causing the motor to run at a different speed. This way of 
regulating the frequency might result in some problems:
• Acoustic noise from the motor, which is sometimes    
 transmitted to the system as disturbing noise
• High voltage peaks on the output from the frequency   
 converter to the motor50 Hz 60 Hz

2a7f6235-062e-4dd1-a12f-c0c573b20f3e,"Insulation for motors with frequency 
converter
In connection with motors with frequency converters we 
distinguish between different kinds of motors, with different 
kinds of insulation.
Motors without phase insulation
For motors constructed without the use of phase 
insulation, continuous voltages (RMS) above 460 V 
can increase the risk of disruptive discharges in the 
windings and thus destruction of the motor. This applies 
to all motors constructed according to these principles. 
Continuous operation with voltage peaks above 650 V can 
cause damage to the motor. 
Motors with phase insulation
In three-phase motors, phase insulation is normally 
used and consequently, specific precautions are not 
necessary if the voltage supply is smaller than 500 V. 
Motors with reinforced insulation
In connection with supply voltages between 500 and 
690 V, the motor has to have reinforced insulation or be 
protected with delta U /delta t filters. For supply voltages 
of 690 V and higher the motor has to be fitted with both 
reinforced insulation and delta U /delta t filters.
Motors with insulated bearings
In order to avoid harmful current flows through the 
bearings, the motor bearings have to be electrically insulated. 
This applies for motors from frame size 280 and up.Fig 1.4.16: Stator with phase insulation

to as phase paper

c16e13b4-bec8-46cd-9742-9513af6ec385,"Motor efficiency
Generally speaking, electric motors are quite efficient. 
Some motors have electricity-to-shaft power efficiencies 
of 80-93% depending on the motor size and sometimes 
even higher for bigger motors. Two types of energy losses 
in electric motors exist: Load dependent losses and load 
independent losses. 
Load dependent losses vary with the square of the current 
and cover:
• Stator winding losses (copper losses) 
• Rotor losses (slip losses) 
• Stray losses (in different parts of the motor)
Load independent losses in the motor refer to:
• Iron losses (core losses) 
• Mechanical losses (friction)
Different motor classifications  categorise motors according 
to efficiency. The most important are CEMEP in the EU (EFF1, 
EFF2 and EFF3) and EPAct in the US.   Motors can fail because of overload for a longer period of 
time and therefore most motors are intentionally oversized 
and only operate at 75% to 80% of their full load capacity. 
At this level of loading, motor efficiency and power factor 
remain relatively high. But when the motor load is less 
than 25%, the efficiency and the power factor decrease. 
The motor efficiency drops quickly below a certain 
percentage of the rated load. Therefore, it is important to 
size the motor so that the losses associated with running 
the motor too far below its rated capacity are minimised. 
It is common to choose a pump motor that meets the 
power requirements of the pump. 
1.4.5 Motor protection
Motors are nearly always protected against reaching temperatures, 
which can damage the insulation system. Depending on 
the construction of the motor and the application, thermal 
protection can also have other functions, e.g. prevent damaging 
temperatures in the frequency converter if it is mounted on 
the motor.
The type of thermal protection varies with the motor type. 
The construction of the motor together with the power 
consumption must be taken into consideration when choosing 
thermal protection. Generally speaking, motors have to be 
protected against the following conditions:
Errors causing slow temperature increases in 
the windings:
• Slow overload
• Long start-up periods
• Reduced cooling / lack of cooling
• Increased ambient temperature
• Frequent starts and stops
• Frequency fluctuation
• Voltage fluctuation
Errors causing fast temperature increases in 
the windings:
• Blocked rotor

a4594f20-0936-4edb-b243-264d4645341d,"Thermal protection (TP)
According to the IEC 60034-11 standard, the thermal 
protection of the motor has to be indicated on the 
nameplate with a TP designation. Figure 1.4.19 shows an 
overview of the TP designations. 
PTC thermistors
PTC thermistors (Positive Temperature Coefficient
Thermistors) can be ﬁtted into the windings of a motor
during production or retroﬁtted afterwards. Usually 3
PTCs are ﬁtted in series; 1 in each phase of the winding.
They can be purchased with trip temperatures ranging
from 90°C to 180°C in 5 degrees steps. PTCs have to be 
connected to a thermistor relay, which detects the rapid 
increase in resistance of the thermistor when it reaches its 
trip temperature. These devices are non-linear. At ambient 
temperatures the resistance of a set of 3 will be about 200-
300 ohms and this will increase rapidly when the thermistor 
reaches its trip temperature.  If the temperature increases 
any further, the PTC thermistor can reach several thousand 
ohms. The thermistor relays are usually set to trip at 3000 
ohms or are preset to trip according to what the DIN 44082 
standard prescribes. The TP designation for PTCs for motors 
smaller than 11kW is TP211 if the PTCs are ﬁtted into the 
windings. If the PTCs are retroﬁtted the TP designation is 
TP111. The TP designation for PTCs for motors larger than 
11kW is normally TP111.Indication of the permissible temperature level when the motor is exposed to thermal

Fig 1.4.19: TP designationsThermal switch and thermostats
Thermal switches are small bi-metallic switches that switch 
due to the temperature. They are available with a wide range 
of trip temperatures; normally open and closed types. The 
most common type is the closed one. One or two, in series, 
are usually ﬁtted in the windings like thermistors and can be 
connected directly to the circuit of the main contactor coil. 
In that way no relay is necessary. This type of protection is 
cheaper than thermistors, but on the other hand, it is less 
sensitive and is not able to detect a locked rotor failure.
Thermal switches are also referred to as Thermik, Klixon 
switches and PTO (Protection Thermique à Ouverture). 
Thermal switches always carry a TP111 designation.
Single-phase motors
Single-phase motors normally come with incorporated  
thermal protection. Thermal protection usually has an 
automatic reclosing. This implies that the motor has to 
be connected to the mains in a way that ensures that 
accidents caused by the automatic reclosing are avoided.
Three-phase motors
Three-phase motors have to be protected according to local 
regulations. This kind of motor has usually incorporated 
contacts for resetting in the external control circuit.

fe1e1594-a3ba-4b1f-82a3-4e59b70dd06a,"51Standstill heating
A heating element ensures the standstill heating of 
the motor. The heating element is especially used in 
connection with applications that struggle with humidity 
and condensation. By using the standstill heating, the 
motor is warmer than the surroundings and thereby the 
relative air humidity inside the motor is always lower than 
100%.
Maintenance    
The motor should be checked at regular intervals. It is 
important to keep the motor clean in order to ensure 
adequate ventilation. If the pump is installed in a dusty 
environment, the pump must be cleaned and checked 
regularly.
Bearings
Normally, motors have a locked bearing in the drive end and 
a bearing with axial play in the non-drive end. Axial play is 
required due to production tolerances, thermal expansion 
during operation, etc. The motor bearings are held in place 
by wave spring washers in the non-drive end, see figure 
1.4.21. The fixed bearing in the drive end can be either a deep-
groove ball bearing or an angular contact bearing. 
Bearing clearances and tolerances are stated according 
to ISO 15 and ISO 492. Because bearing manufacturers 
have to fulfil these standards, bearings are internationally 
interchangeable. 
In order to rotate freely, a ball bearing must have a certain 
internal clearance between the raceway and the balls. 
Without this internal clearance, the bearings can either 
be difficult to rotate or it may even seize up and be unable 
to rotate. On the other hand, too much internal clearance
will result in an unstable bearing that may generate 
excessive noise or allow the shaft to wobble.  
Depending on which pump type the motor is fitted, the 
deep-groove ball bearing in the drive end must have C3 
or C4 clearance. Bearings with C4 clearance are less heat 
sensitive and have increased axial load-carrying capacity. 
The bearing carrying the axial forces of the pump can have 
C3 clearance if:  
• the pump has complete or partial hydraulic relief
• the pump has many brief periods of operation
• the pump has long idle periods
C4 bearings are used for pumps with fluctuating high axial 
forces. Angular contact bearings are used if the pump exerts 
strong one-way axial forces.

For closed permanently lubricated bearings, use one of the 
following high temperature resistant types of grease:
• Lithium-based grease
• Polyurea-based grease
The technical specifications must correspond to the 
standard  DIN - 51825 K2 or better. The basic oil viscosity 
must be higher than:
• 50 cSt (10-6m2/sec) at 40°C and
• 8 cSt (mm2/sec) at 100°C
For example Klüberquiet BQH 72-102 with a grease
filling ratio of: 30 - 40%.
Motors with lubrication system
Normally, frame size 160 motors and upwards have 
lubricating nipples for the bearings both in the drive end 
and the non-drive end.The lubricating nipples are visible and easily accessible. 
The motor is designed in such a way that: 
• there is a flow of grease around the bearing
• new grease enters the bearing
• old grease is removed from the bearing
Motors with lubricating systems are supplied with a 
lubricating instruction, for instance as a label on the 
fan cover. Apart from that, instructions are given in the 
installation and operating instructions.
The lubricant is often lithium-based, high temperature 
grease, for instance EXXON UNIREX N3 or Shell Alvania 
Grease G3. The basic oil viscosity must be 
• higher than 50 cSt (10-6m2/sec) at 40°C and

Liquids
1.5.1  Viscous liquids
There is no doubt about it; water is the most common 
liquid that pumps handle. However, in a number of 
applications, pumps have to handle other types of liquids, 
e.g. oil, propylene glycol, gasoline. Compared to water, 
these types of liquids have different density and viscosity.  
Viscosity is a measure of the thickness of the liquid. 
The higher the viscosity, the thicker the liquid. Propylene 
glycol and motor oil are examples of thick or high viscous 
liquids. Gasoline and water are examples of thin, low 
viscous liquids.
Two kinds of viscosity exist: 
• The dynamic viscosity ( µ), which is normally measured   
 in Pa ⋅s or Poise. (1 Poise = 0.1 Pa ⋅s) 
• The kinematic viscosity ( ν), which is normally measured  
 in centiStokes or m2/s (1 cSt = 10-6 m2/s) 
The relation between the dynamic viscosity ( µ) and the 
kinematic viscosity ( ν) is shown in the formula on your 
right hand side.
On the following pages, we will only focus on kinematic 
viscosity ( ν).
The viscosity of a liquid changes considerably with the 
change in temperature; hot oil is thinner than cold oil. As 
you can tell from figure 1.5.1, a 50% propylene glycol liquid 
increases its viscosity 10 times when the temperature 
changes from +20 to –20 oC.

520576b1-3ed3-427a-8cbc-c8e3f85bb51e,"1.5.2 Non-Newtonian liquids 
The liquids discussed so far are referred to as Newtonian 
fluids. The viscosity of Newtonian liquids is not affected by 
the magnitude and the motion that they are exposed to. 
Mineral oil and water are typical examples of this type of 
liquid. On the other hand, the viscosity of non-Newtonian 
liquids does change when agitated. 
This calls for a few examples:
• Dilatant liquids like cream – the viscosity increases   
 when agitated
• Plastic fluids like catsup – have a yield value, which has  
 to be exceeded before flow starts. From that point on,   
 the viscosity decreases with an increase in agitation
• Thixotrophic liquids like non-drip paint - exhibit a   
 decreasing viscosity with an increase in agitation
The non-Newtonian liquids are not covered by the viscosity 
formula described earlier in this section.
1.5.3 The impact of viscous liquids on the 
performance of a centrifugal pump
Viscous liquids, that is liquids with higher viscosity and/
or higher density than water, affect the performance of 
centrifugal pumps in different ways:
• Power consumption increases, i.e. a larger motor may   
    be required to perform the same task
• Head, flow rate and pump efficiency are reduced 
Let us have a look at an example. A pump is used for 
pumping a liquid in a cooling system with a liquid 
temperature below 0oC. To avoid that the liquid freezes, 
an antifreeze agent like propylene glycol is added to 
the water. When glycol or a similar antifreeze agent is 
added to the pumped liquid, the liquid obtains properties,  
different from those of water. The liquid will have:• Lower freezing point, tf [°C]
• Lower specific heat, cp [kJ/kg.K]
• Lower thermal conductivity, λ [W/m.K]
• Higher boiling point, tb [°C]
• Higher coefficient of expansion, β [m/°C]
• Higher density, ρ [kg/m3]
• Higher kinematic viscosity, ν [cSt]
These properties have to be kept in mind when designing 
a system and selecting pumps. As mentioned earlier, 
the higher density requires increased motor power and 
the higher viscosity reduces pump head, flow rate and 
efficiency resulting in a need for increased motor power, 
see figure 1.5.2.

91a92ce2-6b73-4365-ba21-d60e05a529b6,"1.5.4 Selecting the right pump for a 
liquid with antifreeze
Pump characteristics are usually based on water at around 
20°C, i.e. a kinematic viscosity of approximately 1 cSt and 
a density of approximately 1,000 kg/m³.
When pumps are used for liquids containing antifreeze 
below 0°C, it is necessary to examine whether the pump 
can supply the required performance or whether  a 
larger motor is required. The following section presents 
a simplified method used to determine pump curve 
corrections for pumps in systems that have to handle a 
viscosity between 5 - 100 cSt and a density of maximum 
1,300 kg/m³. Please notice that this method is not as 
precise as the computer aided method described later in 
this section.
Pump curve corrections for pumps handling high 
viscous liquid
Based on knowledge about required duty point, QS, HS, and 
kinematic viscosity of the pumped liquid, the correction 
factors of H and P2 can be found, see figure 1.5.3.

When kH and kP2 are found in the figure, the equivalent 
head for clean water HW and the corrected actual shaft 
power P2S can be calculated by the following formula
where
HW : is the equivalent head of the pump if the pumped   
 liquid is “clean” water
P2W :  is the shaft power at the duty point (QS,HW) when 
 the pumped liquid is water
HS :  is the desired head of the pumped liquid

ρw :  is the density of water = 998 kg/m3
The pump selection is based on the normal data sheets/
curves applying to water. The pump should cover the duty 
point Q,H = QS,HW, and the motor should be powerful 
enough to handle P2S on the shaft.

A circulator pump in a refrigeration system is to pump a 
40% (weight) propylene glycol liquid at –10°C. The desired 
flow is QS = 60 m3/h, and the desired head is HS = 12 m. 
Knowing the required duty point, it is possible to find the QH-
characteristic for water and choose a pump, which is able to 
cover the duty point. Once we have determined the needed 
pump type and size we can check if the pump is fitted with a 
motor, which can handle the specific pump load.
The liquid has kinematic viscosity of 20 cSt and a density 
of 1049 kg/m3. With QS = 60 m3/h, HS = 12 m and ν = 20 cSt, 
the correction factors can be found in figure 1.5.3.
 kH = 1.03 
 kP2 = 1.15
 HW = kH · HS = 1.03 · 12 = 12.4 m 
 QS = 60 m3/h
The pump has to be able to cover a duty point equivalent 
to Q,H = 60 m3/h, 12.4m. Once the necessary pump size is 
determined, the P2 value for the duty point is found, which 
in this case is P2W = 2.9 kW. Now it is possible to calculate 
the required motor power for propylene glycol mixture:
The calculation shows, that the pump has to be fitted with 
a 4 kW motor, which is the smallest motor size able to 
cover the calculated P2S = 3.5 kW. 1.5.6 Computer aided pump selection for 
dense and viscous liquids 
Some computer aided pump selection tools include a 
feature that compensates for the pump performance 
curves based on input of the liquid density and viscosity. 
Figure 1.5.5 shows the pump performance curves from the 
example we just went through.  
The figure shows both the performance curves for the 
pump when it handles viscous liquid (the full lines) and 
the performance curves when it handles water (the broken 
lines). As indicated head, flow and efficiency are reduced, 
resulting in an increase in power consumption. 
The value of P2 is 3.4 kW, which corresponds to the result 
we got in the calculation example in section 1.5.4.

Materials
In this section you can read about different materials that 
are used for pump construction. Our main focus will be 
on the features that every single metal and metal alloy 
have to offer. But before we dig any further into the 
world of materials, we will have a closer look at corrosion. 
Besides explaining what corrosion is, we will examine the 
different types of corrosion and what can be done to 
prevent corrosion from occurring. 
1.6.1 What is corrosion?
Corrosion is usually referred to as the degradation of the 
metal by chemical or electrochemical reaction with its 
environment, see figure 1.6.1. When considered broadly, 
corrosion may be looked upon as the tendency of the 
metal to revert to its natural state similar to the oxide 
from which it was originally melted. Only precious metals, 
such as gold and platinum are found in nature in their 
metallic state.
Some metals produce a tight protective oxide layer on the 
surface, which hinders further corrosion. If the surface 
layer is broken it is self-healing. These metals are passivated.  
Under atmospheric conditions the corrosion products
of zinc and aluminium form a fairly tight layer and 
further corrosion is prevented. 
Likewise, on the surface of stainless steel a tight layer of 
iron and chromium oxide is formed and on the surface of 
titanium a layer of titanium oxide is formed. The protective 
layer of these metals explains their good corrosion 
resistance. Rust, on the other hand, is a non-protective 
corrosion product on steel. 
Rust is porous, not firmly adherent and does not prevent  
continued corrosion, see figure 1.6.2.pH (acidity)

Generally, metallic corrosion involves the loss of metal at 
a spot on an exposed surface. Corrosion occurs in various 
forms ranging from uniform attacks over the entire surface 
to severe local attacks. 
The environment’s chemical and physical conditions 
determine both the type and the rate of corrosion attacks. The 
conditions also determine the type of corrosion products that 
are formed and the control measures that need to be taken. In 
many cases, it is impossible or rather expensive to completely 
stop the corrosion process; however, it is usually possible to 
control the process to acceptable levels. 
On the following pages we will go through the different 
forms of corrosion in order to give you an idea of their 
characteristics.
Uniform corrosion 
Uniform or general corrosion is characterised by corrosive 
attacks proceeding evenly over the entire surface, or on a 
large part of the total area. General thinning continues until 
the metal is broken down. Uniform corrosion is the type of 
corrosion where the largest amount of metal is wasted.
Examples of metals, which are subject to uniform 
corrosion: 
• Steel in aerated water
• Stainless steel in reducing acids (such as EN 1.4301 
 (AISI 304) in sulfuric acid)
Pitting corrosion
Pitting corrosion is a localised form of corrosive attacks. 
Pitting corrosion forms holes or pits on the metal surface. 
It perforates the metal while the total corrosion, measured 
by weight loss, might be rather minimal.  The rate of 
penetration may be 10 to 100 times that of general 
corrosion depending on the aggressiveness of the liquid. 
Pitting occurs more easily in a stagnant environment.
Example of metal that is subject to pitting corrosion: 
• Stainless steel in seawaterFig. 1.6.3: Uniform corrosion

Crevice corrosion
Crevice corrosion - like pitting corrosion - is a localised 
form of corrosion attack. However, crevice corrosion starts 
more easily than pitting. Crevice corrosion occurs at narrow 
openings or spaces between two metal surfaces or between 
metals and non-metal surfaces and is usually associated 
with a stagnate condition in the crevice. Crevices, such as 
those found at flange joints or at threaded connections, 
are thus often the most critical spots for corrosion.
Example of metal that is subject to crevice corrosion: 
• Stainless steel in seawater
Intergranular corrosion
As the name implies, intergranular corrosion occurs at 
grain boundaries. Intergranular corrosion is also called 
intercrystalline corrosion. Typically, this type of corrosion 
occurs when chromium carbide precipitates at the grain 
boundaries during the welding process or in connection 
with insufficient heat treatment. A narrow region around 
the grain boundary may therefore deplete in chromium 
and become less corrosion resistant than the rest of the 
material. This is unfortunate because chromium plays an 
important role in corrosion resistance.
Examples of metals that are subject to intergranular corrosion:
• Stainless steel - which is insufficiently welded or 
 heat-treated
• Stainless steel EN 1.4401 (AISI 316) in concentrated 
 nitric acid
Selective corrosion
Selective corrosion is a type of corrosion which attacks 
one single element of an alloy and dissolves the element 
in the alloy structure. Consequently, the alloy’s structure 
is weakened. 
Examples of selective corrosion:
• The dezincification of unstabilised brass, whereby a   
 weakened, porous copper structure is produced  
• Graphitisation of gray cast iron, whereby a brittle 
 graphite skeleton is left because of the dissolution 
 of ironFig. 1.6.5: Crevice corrosion

6d427ef8-2370-444a-8173-a90f7fca0a99,"Erosion corrosion
Erosion corrosion is a process that involves corrosion 
and erosion. The rate of corrosion attack is accelerated 
by the relative motion of a corrosive liquid and a 
metal surface. The attack is localised in areas with 
high velocity or turbulent flow. Erosion corrosion 
attacks are characterised by grooves with directional 
pattern. 
Examples of metals which are subject to erosion corrosion:
• Bronze in seawater
• Copper in water
Cavitation corrosion
A pumped liquid with high velocity reduces the pressure. 
When the pressure drops below the liquid vapour 
pressure, vapour bubbles form (the liquid boils).  
In the areas where the vapour bubbles form, the
liquid is boiling. When the pressure raises again, the 
vapour bubbles collapse and produce intensive 
shockwaves. Consequently, the collapse of the vapour 
bubbles remove metal or oxide from the surface.   
Examples of metals that are subject to cavitation:  
• Cast iron in water at high temperature
• Bronze in seawater
Stress corrosion cracking (SCC)
Stress corrosion cracking (SCC) refers to the combined 
influence of tensile stress (applied or internal) and 
corrosive environment. The material can crack without 
any significant deformation or obvious deterioration of 
the material. Often, pitting corrosion is associated with 
the stress corrosion cracking phenomena.
Examples of metals that are subject to stress corrosion 
cracking:
• Stainless steel EN 1.4401 (AISI 316) in chlorides
• Brass in ammoniaFig. 1.6.8: Erosion corrosion

Corrosion fatigue
Pure mechanical fatigue is when a material subjected 
to a cyclic load far below the ultimate tensile strength 
can fail. If the metal is simultaneously  exposed to a 
corrosive environment, the failure can take place at an 
even lower stress and after a shorter time. Contrary to 
a pure mechanical fatigue, there is no fatigue limit in 
corrosion-assisted fatigue.
Example of metals that are subject to corrosion fatigue:
• Aluminium structures in corrosive atmosphere
Galvanic corrosion
When a corrosive electrolyte and two metallic materials 
are in contact (galvanic cell), corrosion increases on the 
least noble material (the anode) and decreases on the 
noblest (the cathode). The increase in corrosion is called 
galvanic corrosion. The tendency of a metal or an alloy 
to corrode in a galvanic cell is determined by its position 
in the galvanic series. The galvanic series indicates the 
relative nobility of different metals and alloys in a given 
environment (e.g. seawater, see figure 1.6.12).
The farther apart the metals are in the galvanic series, 
the greater the galvanic corrosion effect will be. Metals or 
alloys at the upper end are noble, while those at the lower 
end are least noble.
 
Examples of metal that are subject to galvanic corrosion:
• Steel in contact with 1.4401
• Aluminium in contact with copper
The principles of galvanic corrosion are used in cathodic 
protection. Cathodic protection is a means of reducing 
or preventing the corrosion of a metal surface by the 
use of sacrificial anodes (zinc or aluminum) or impressed 
currents. Fig. 1.6.11: Corrosion fatigue

On the following pages, you can read about the features 
of different metals and metal alloys, used for construction 
of pumps.
Ferrous alloys 
Ferrous alloys are alloys where iron is the prime constituent.
Ferrous alloys are the most common of all materials 
because of their availability, low cost, and versatility.
Steel
Steel is a widely used material primarily composed of iron 
alloyed with carbon. The amount of carbon in steel varies 
in the range from 0.003% to 1.5% by weight. The content of 
carbon has an important impact on the material’s strength, 
weldability, machinability, ductility, and hardness. As a 
rule-of-thumb, an increase in carbon content will lead to 
an increase in strength and hardness but to a decrease in 
ductility and weldability. The most common type of steel is 
carbon steel. Carbon steel is grouped into four categories, 
see figure 1.6.14.
Steel is available in wrought as well as in cast condition.  
The general characteristics of steel castings are closely 
comparable to those of wrought steels. The most obvious
advantage of steel is that it is relatively inexpensive to make, 
form and process. On the other hand, the disadvantage 
of steel is that its corrosion resistance is low compared to 
alternative materials, such as stainless steel.Cavitation corrosion of bronze impeller

9af2ff09-7ca7-43fc-a550-58a06fcd382d,"Nodular (ductile) iron  
Nodular iron contains around 0.03-0.05% by weight of 
magnesium. Magnesium causes the flakes to become 
globular so the graphite is dispersed throughout a ferrite 
or pearlite matrix in the form of spheres or nodules. The 
graphite nodules have no sharp features. The round shape 
of nodular graphite reduces the stress concentration and 
consequently, the material is much more ductile than grey 
iron. Figure 1.6.16 clearly shows that the tensile strength is 
higher for nodular iron than is the case for grey iron. Nodular 
iron is normally used for pump parts with high strength 
requirements (high pressure or high temperature 
applications). 
Stainless steel
Stainless steel is chromium containing steel alloys. The 
minimum chromium content in standardised stainless 
steel is 10.5%. Chromium improves the corrosion resistance 
of stainless steel. The higher corrosion resistance is due 
to a chromium oxide film that is formed on the metal 
surface. This extremely thin layer is self-repairing under 
the right conditions.
Molybdenum, nickel and nitrogen are other examples of 
typical alloying elements.  Alloying with these elements 
brings out different crystal structures, which enable 
different properties in connection with machining, forming, 
welding, corrosion resistance, etc. In general, stainless 
steel has a higher resistance to chemicals (i.e. acids) than 
steel and cast iron have. Cast iron
Cast iron can be considered an alloy of iron, silicon 
and carbon. Typically, the concentration of carbon is 
between 3-4% by weight, most of which is present 
in insoluble form (e.g. graphite flakes or nodules). 
The two main types are grey cast iron and nodular 
(ductile) cast iron. The corrosion resistance of cast iron is 
comparable to the one for steel; and sometimes even better. 
Cast iron can be alloyed with 13-16% by weight silicon or 
15-35% by weight nickel (Ni-resist) respectively in order to 
improve corrosion resistance. Various types of cast irons are 
widely used in industry, especially for valves, pumps, pipes 
and automotive parts. Cast iron has good corrosion resistance 
to neutral and alkaline liquids (high pH) . But its resistance to 
acids (low pH) is poor.
Grey iron
In grey iron, the graphite is dispersed throughout a ferrite 
or pearlite matrix in the form of flakes. Fracture surfaces 
take on a grey appearance (hence the name!). The graphite 
flakes act as stress concentrators under tensile loads, 
making it weak and brittle in tension, but strong 
and ductile in compression. Grey iron is used for the 
construction of motor blocks because of its high vibration 
damping ability. Grey iron is an inexpensive material and 
is relatively easy to cast with a minimal risk of shrinkage. 
That is why grey iron is often used for pump parts with 
moderate strength requirements.1. Design of pumps and motors

be attacked by localised corrosion, e.g. pitting  corrosion  
and crevice corrosion. The resistance of stainless steel to 
these types of corrosion is highly dependent on its 
chemical composition. It has become rather common to 
use the so-called PRE (Pitting Resistance Equivalent) 
values as a measure of pitting resistance for stainless 
steel. PRE values are calculated by formulas in which the

ae46290d-13f8-428a-ba4f-a05ef660c63a,"Ferritic (magnetic) 
Ferritic stainless steel is characterised by quite good 
corrosion properties, very good resistance to stress 
corrosion cracking and moderate toughness. Low alloyed 
ferritic stainless steel is used in mild environments 
(teaspoons, kitchen sinks, washing machine drums, 
etc.) where it is a requirement that the component is 
maintenance-free and non-rusting. 
Martensitic (magnetic)
Martensitic stainless steel is characterised by high strength 
and limited corrosion resistance. Martensitic steels are 
used for springs, shafts, surgical instruments and for 
sharp-edged tools, such as knives and scissors. 
Austenitic (non-magnetic)
Austenitic stainless steel is the most common type 
of stainless steel and is characterised by a high 
corrosion resistance, very good formability, toughness 
and weldability. Austenitic stainless steel, especially 
the EN 1.4301 and EN 1.4401 are used for almost any 
type of pump components in the industry. This kind of 
stainless steel can be either wrought or cast.
 
EN 1.4305 is one of the most popular stainless steel types 
of all the free machining stainless steel types. Due to its 
high sulphur content (0.15-0.35 w%), the machinability has 
improved considerably but unfortunately at the expense 
of its corrosion resistance and its weldability. However, 
over the years free machining grades with a low sulphur 
content and thus a higher corrosion resistance have been 
developed.
If stainless steel is heated up to 500°C - 800°C for a 
longer period of time during welding, the chromium 
might form chromium carbides with the carbon present in 
the steel. This reduces chromium’s capability to maintain 
the passive film and might lead to intergranular corrosion 
also referred to as sensitisation (see section 1.6.2).
If low carbon grades of stainless steel are used the risk of 
sensitisation is reduced. Stainless steel with a low content 1. Design of pumps and motors
1.1 Pump construction, (10)
of carbon is referred to as EN 1.4306 (AISI 304L) or EN 
1.4404 (AISI 316L). Both grades contain 0.03% of carbon 
compared to 0.07% in the regular type of stainless steel 
EN 1.4301 (AISI 304) and EN 1.4401 (AISI 316), see 
illustration 1.6.17.
The stabilised grades EN 1.4571 (AISI 316Ti) contain a small 
amount of titanium. Because titanium has a higher affinity  
for carbon than chromium, the formation of chromium 
carbides is minimised. The content of carbon is generally 
low in modern stainless steel, and with the easy availability 
of ‘L’ grades the use of stabilised grades has declined 
markedly.
Ferritic-austenitic or duplex (magnetic)
Ferritic-austenitic (duplex) stainless steel is characterised 
by high strength, good toughness, high corrosion resistance  
and excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking and 
corrosion fatigue in particular.
Ferritic-austenitic stainless steel is typically used in 
applications that require high strength, high corrosion 
resistance and low susceptibility to stress corrosion cracking 
or a combination of these properties. Stainless steel 
EN 1.4462 is widely used for making pump shafts and pump 
housings.

6a9e6f14-b755-4f86-ba2b-46c6c630a631,"Nickel alloys  
Nickel base alloys are defined as alloys in which nickel 
is present in greater proportion than any other alloying 
element. The most important alloying constituents are 
iron, chromium, copper, and molybdenum. The alloying 
constituents make it possible to form a wide range of 
alloy classes. Nickel and nickel alloys have the ability to 
withstand a wide variety of severe operating conditions, 
for instance corrosive environments, high temperatures, 
high stresses or a combination of these factors. 
HastelloysTM  alloys are a line of commercial alloys containing 
Ni, Mo, Cr, and Fe. Nickel base alloys, such as InconelTM 
Alloy 625, HastelloysTM C-276 and C-22 are highly corrosion 
resistant and not subject to pitting or crevice corrosion in 
low velocity seawater, and do not suffer from erosion at 
high velocity. 
 
The price of nickel base alloy limits its use in certain 
applications. Nickel alloys are available in both wrought 
and cast grades. However, nickel alloys are more difficult 
to cast than the common carbon steels and stainless steel 
alloys. Nickel alloys are especially used for pump parts in 
the chemical process industry.Copper alloys
Pure copper has excellent thermal and electrical properties, 
but is a very soft and ductile material. 
Alloying additions result in different cast and wrought 
materials, which are suitable for use in the production of 
pumps, pipelines, fittings, pressure vessels and for many 
marine, electrical and general engineering applications.
Brasses are the most widely used of the copper alloys 
because of their low cost, their easy or inexpensive 
fabrication and machining. However, they are inferior in 
strength to bronzes and must not be used in environments 
that cause dezincification (see selective corrosion).
Red brass, bronze and copper nickels in particular have, 
compared to cast iron a high resistance to chlorides in 
aggressive liquids, such as seawater. In such environments, 
brass is unsuitable because of its tendency to dezincificate.  
All copper alloys have poor resistance to alkaline liquids 
(high pH), ammonia and sulfides and are sensitive to 
erosion. Brass, red brass and bronze are widely used for 
making  bearings, impellers and pump housings.  
1) Lead can be added as an alloying element to improve 
the machinability.
2) Bronze can be alloyed with aluminium to increase strength.

5de1d2e1-78f8-42de-8314-ae980a170d63,"Titanium
Pure titanium has a low density, is quite ductile and has a 
relatively low strength.  However, when a limited amount 
of oxygen is added it will strengthen titanium and produce 
the so-called commercial-pure grades. Additions of various 
alloying elements, such as aluminium and vanadium 
increase its strength significantly, at the expense of 
ductility. The aluminium and vanadium alloyed titanium 
(Ti-6Al-4V) is the “workhorse” alloy of the titanium 
industry. It is used in many aerospace engine and airframe 
components. Because titanium is a high-price material, it 
is not yet a material which is often used for making pump 
components. 
Titanium is a very reactive material. As it is the case for 
stainless steel, titanium’s corrosion resistance depends on 
the formation of an oxide film. However, the oxide film 
is more protective than that on stainless steel. Therefore, 
titanium performs much better than stainless steel in 
aggressive liquids, such as seawater, wet chlorine or 
organic chlorides, that cause pitting and crevice corrosion.1. Design of pumps and motors
1.1 Pump construction, (10)
Aluminium
 
Pure aluminium is a light and soft metal with a density 
of about a third of that of steel. Pure aluminium has a 
high electrical and thermal conductivity. The most common 
alloying elements are silicon (silumin), magnesium, iron and 
copper.  Silicon increases the material’s castability, copper 
increases its machinability and magnesium increases its 
corrosion resistance and strength. 
The obvious advantages of aluminium are that the material 
naturally generates a protective oxide film and is highly 
corrosion resistant if it is exposed to the atmosphere. 
Treatment, such as anodising, can further improve this 
property. Aluminium alloys are widely used in structures  
where a high strength to weight ratio is important, such 
as in the transportation industry. For example, the use of 
aluminium in vehicles and aircrafts reduces weight and 
energy consumption.
On the other hand, the disadvantage of aluminium is that 
it is not stable at low or high pH and in chloride-containing 
environments. This property makes aluminium unsuitable for 
exposure to aqueous solutions especially under conditions 
with high flow. This is further emphasised by the fact that 
aluminium is a reactive metal, i.e. has a low position in the 
galvanic series (see galvanic corrosion) and may easily suffer 
from galvanic corrosion if coupled to nobler metals and 
alloys. Designation  Major alloying element

are composed of metallic and non-metallic elements. 
Common technical ceramics are aluminium oxide (alumina 
- Al2O3), silicon carbide (SiC), tungsten carbide (WC), and 
silicon nitride (Si3N4). 
Ceramics are suitable for applications which require high 
thermal stability, high strength, high wear resistance, and 
high corrosion resistance. The disadvantage of ceramics is 
the low ductility and high tendency for brittle fractures. 
Ceramics are mainly used for making bearings and seal 
faces for shaft seals.
1.6.5 Plastics
Some plastics are derived from natural substances, such as 
plants, but most types are man-made. These are known as 
synthetic plastics. Most synthetic plastics come from crude 
oil, but coal and natural gas are also used. 
There are two main types of plastics: Thermoplastics and 
thermosets (thermosetting plastics). The thermoplastics 
are the most common kind of plastic used worldwide. 
Plastics often contain additives, which transfer certain 
additional properties to the material. Furthermore, 
plastics can be reinforced with fiberglass or other fibres. 
These plastics together with additives and ﬁbres are also 
referred to as composites.
  Examples of additives found in plastics
• Inorganic fillers for mechanical reinforcement 
• Chemical stabilisers, e.g. antioxidants 
• Plasticisers 
• Flame retardants  Thermoplastics
Thermoplastic polymers consist of long polymer molecules 
that are not linked to each other, i.e. have no cross-links. 
They are often supplied as granules and heated to permit 
fabrication by methods, such as moulding or extrusion. 
A wide range is available, from low-cost commodity plastics 
(e.g. PE, PP, PVC) to high cost engineering thermoplastics 
(e.g. PEEK) and chemical resistant fluoropolymers (e.g. 
PTFE, PVDF). PTFE is one of the few thermoplastics, which 
is not melt-processable. Thermoplastics are widely used 
for making pump housings or for lining of pipes and pump 
housings. 
Thermosets
Thermosets harden permanently when heated, as cross-
linking hinders bending and rotations. Cross-linking is 
achieved during fabrication using chemicals, heat, or 
radiation; this process is called curing or vulcanization. 
Thermosets are harder, more dimensionally stable, and 
more brittle than thermoplastics and cannot be remelted. 
Important thermosets include epoxies, polyesters, 
and polyurethanes. Thermosets are among other things 
used for surface coatings.PP

1.6.6 Rubber 
The term rubber includes both natural rubber and 
synthetic rubber. Rubbers (or elastomers) are flexible long-
chain polymers that can be stretched easily to several times 
their unstretched length and which rapidly return to their 
original dimensions when the applied stress is released. 
Rubbers are cross-linked (vulcanized), but have a low cross-
link density, see figure 1.6.22. The cross-link is the key to 
the elastic, or rubbery, properties of these materials. The 
elasticity provides resiliency in sealing applications. Different 
components in a pump are made of rubber, e.g. gaskets
and O-rings (see section 1.3 on shaft seals). In this section we 
will present the different kinds of rubber qualities and their 
main properties as regards temperature and resistance to 
different kinds of liquid groups.
At temperatures up to about 100°C nitrile rubber is an 
inexpensive material that has a high resistance to oil and 
fuel. Different grades exist - the higher the acrylonitrile 
(ACN) content, the higher the oil resistance, but the poorer 
is the low temperature flexibility. Nitrile rubbers have high 
resilience and high wear resistance but only moderate 
strength. Further, the rubber has limited weathering 
resistance and poor solvent resistance. It can generally be 
used down to about -30°C, but certain grades can operate 
at lower temperatures.Ethylene propylene has excellent water resistance which 
is maintained to high temperatures approximately 120-
140°C. The rubber type has good resistance to acids, strong 
alkalis and highly polar fluids, such as methanol and 
acetone. However, it has very poor resistance to mineral 
oil and fuel.
Fluoroelastomers (FKM) 
Fluoroelastomers cover a whole family of rubbers designed 
to withstand oil, fuel and a wide range of chemicals 
including non-polar solvents.   offers excellent 
resistance to high temperature operation (up to 200°C 
depending on the grade) in air and different types of oil. 
 rubbers have limited resistance to steam, hot water, 
methanol, and other highly polar fluids. Further, this type 
of rubber has poor resistance to amines, strong alkalis 
and many freons. There are standard and special grades 
- the latter have special properties, such as improved low-
temperature or chemical resistance. 
 
Silicone rubbers have outstanding properties, such as low 
compression set in a wide range of temperatures (from 
-60°C to 200°C in air), excellent electrical insulation and 
are non-toxic. Silicone rubbers are resistant to water, 
some acids and oxidizing chemicals. Concentrated acids, 
alkalines, and solvents should not be used with silicone 
rubbers. In general, these types of rubber have poor 
resistance to oil and fuel. However, the resistance of FMQ 
silicone rubber to oil and fuel is better than that of the 
silicone rubber types MQ, VMQ, and PMQ.
Perfluoroelastomers have very high chemical resistance, 
almost comparable to that of PTFE (polytetrafluorethylene, 
e.g. TeflonR). They can be used up to high temperatures, 
but their disadvantages are difficult processing, very high 
cost and limited use at low temperatures.  Common types of c opper alloys

Protective coating – metallic, non-metallic (inorganic)  
or organic – is a common method of corrosion control. The 
main function of coatings is (aside from galvanic coatings, 
such as zinc) to provide an effective barrier between the 
metal (substrate) and its environment. They allow the use 
of normal steel or aluminium instead of more expensive 
materials. In the following section we will examine 
the possibilities of preventing corrosion by means of 
different coatings: 
Metallic and  non-metallic (inorganic) coatings and organic 
coatings.
Metallic coatings
Metallic coatings less noble than the substrate
Zinc coatings are commonly used for the protection of 
steel structures against atmospheric corrosion. Zinc has 
two functions: it acts as a barrier coating and it provides 
galvanic protection. Should an exposed area of steel 
occur, the zinc surface preferentially corrodes at a slow 
rate and protects the steel. The preferential protection  
is referred to as cathodic protection. When damage is 
small, the protective corrosion products of zinc will fill the 
exposed area and stop the attack.  
Metallic coatings nobler than the substrate
Electroplating of nickel and chromium coatings on steel 
are examples of metallic coatings that are nobler than 
the substrate. Unlike galvanic coatings where the coating 
corrodes near areas where the base metal is exposed, 
any void or damage in a barrier coating can lead to an 
immediate base metal attack.To protec t the base steel,  
zinc coating sacrifices itself 
slowly by galv anic ac tion.Steel coated with a more noble 
metal,  such as nickel,  corrodes 
more rapidly if the coating 
is damaged .

As mentioned above, paints are an important class of 
organic coating. Figure 1.6.25 shows several types of 
organic coatings. A typical paint formulation contains 
polymeric binders, solvents, pigments and additives. For 
environmental reasons, organic solvents are increasingly 
being replaced by water or simply eliminated, e.g powder 
coating. Painted metal structures usually involve two or 
more layers of coating applied on a primary coating, which 
is in direct contact with the metal.    1. Design of pumps and motors

Non-metallic coatings 
(inorganic coatings)
Conversion coatings are an important category of non-
metallic coatings (inorganic). 
Conversion coatings
Conversion coatings are formed by a controlled corrosion 
reaction of the substrate in an oxidised  solution. 
Well-known examples of conversion coatings are anodising 
or chromating of aluminium, and phosphate treatment of 
steel.  Anodising is mainly used for surface protection of 
aluminium, while chromating and phosphating are usually 
used for pre-treatment in connection with painting. 
Besides improving paint adhesion, it helps to prevent the 
spreading of rust under layers of paint.
Organic coatings 
Organic coatings contain organic compounds and are 
available in a wide range of different types. Organic coatings  
are applied to the metal by methods of spraying, dipping, 
brushing, lining or electro-coating (paint applied by means 
of electric current) and they may or may not require 
heat-curing. Both thermoplastic coatings, such as 
polyamide, polypropylene, polyethylene, PVDF and PTFE and 
elastomer coatings are applied to metal substrates to 
combine the mechanical properties of metal with the 
chemical resistance of plastics but paints are by far the 
most widely used organic coating. Physical states of common organic coatings

26eb9839-b3a1-4e6a-a7d2-7655e6c06d1f,"Correct advice and selection of pump type for an installation 
has larger implication than what meets the eye. The 
larger the pumps, the greater the costs with respect 
to investment, installation, commissioning, running 
and maintenance – basically the life cycle cost (LCC). An 
extensive product portfolio combined with competent 
advice and after-sales service is the foundation of a correct 
selection. The following analysis, recommendations and 
hints are general for any installation, but to a greater 
extent relevant for medium-sized and large installations. 
We will present our recommendations for two types of 
installation: New and existing installations.
2.1.1 New installation
• If the pipework has not been planned yet, you can base  
 the selection of pump type on other primary selection 
 criteria, e.g. efficiency, investment costs or life cycle 
 costs (LCC). This will not be covered in this 
 section. However, the general guidelines, which are 
 presented, also apply for pipework that has not yet 
 been planned.
• If the pipework has already been planned, the selection  
 of pump is equivalent to replacing a pump in an existing
 installation.
762.1.2 Existing installation – replacement
The following five steps will help you make an optimum 
pump selection for an existing installation:
Pre-investigation of the installation should include 
the following considerations:
• Basic pipe flow – pipes in and out of the building, e.g.   
 from ground, along floor or from ceiling
• Specific pipework at the point of installation, e.g. 
 in-line or end-suction, dimensions, manifolds
• Space available – width, depth and height
• Accessibility in connection with installation and 
 maintenance, for instance doorways
• Availability of lifting equipment or alternatively 
 accessibility of such equipment
• Floor type, e.g. solid or suspended floor with basement
• Existing foundation
• Existing electric installation
Previous pump installation
• Pump make, type, specifications including old duty   
 point, shaft seal, materials, gaskets, controlling
• History, e.g. lifetime, maintenance
Future requirements
• Desired improvements and benefits
• New selection criteria including duty points and 
 operating times, temperature, pressure, liquid 
 specifications
• Supplier criteria, e.g. availability of spare parts
Advisory
• Major changes might be beneficial in a long or short 
 term or both and must be documented, e.g. installation
  savings, life cycle costs (LCC), reduction on environmenta l 
 impact like noise and vibrations and accessibility in 
 connection with maintenance
Selection
• Must be based on a customer-agreed list of priorities
For the selection of the correct pump type and advice on 
installation, two main areas are important: Pipe flow and 
limitation of noise and vibrations. These two areas will
be dealt with on the following pages.Section 2.1

Figure 2.1.1 is based on single-pump installation. In parallel installations accessibility plays a 
major role for how good a pump choice is. 
The evaluation criterion is as simple pipework as possible, hence as few bends as possible.

66ecab20-bbe2-442d-9d86-97b4fb944ba5,"Accessibility plays a major role in how well a specific pump 
choice is in connection with installation of several pumps 
in parallel. The accessibility is not always easy for in-line 
pumps installed in parallel because of the pipework, see 
figure 2.1.2.  As it appears from figure 2.1.3, end-suction 
pumps installed in parallel provide easier accessibility.
2.1.4 Limitation of noise and vibrations
To achieve optimum operation and minimise noise and 
vibration, it may be necessary to consider vibration 
dampening of the pump in certain cases. Generally, this 
should always be considered in the case of pumps with 
motors above 7.5 kW. Smaller motor sizes, however, may 
also cause undesirable noise and vibration. Noise and 
vibration are generated by the rotation in motor and 
pump and by the flow in pipes and fittings. The effect 
on the environment depends on correct installation and 
the state of the entire system. Below we will present 3 
different ways of limiting noise and vibration in a pump 
installation: Foundation, dampeners and expansion joint.
Foundation
Floor constructions can be divided into two types: Solid 
floor and suspended floor.
 Solid  – minimum risk of noise due to bad 
 transmission of vibrations, see figure 2.1.4.
 Suspended  – risk of floor amplifying the noise.   
 Basement can act as a resonance box, 
 see figure 2.1.5.
The pump should be installed on a plane and rigid surface. 
Four basic ways of installation exist for the two types 
of floor construction: Floor, plinth, floating plinth and 
foundation suspended on vibration dampeners.Fig. 2.1.3:

Plinth  
Poured directly on concrete floor, hence as floor, see

reduced risk of vibration transmission, see figure 2.1.8.

transmission, see figure 2.1.9.
As a rule of thumb, the weight of a concrete foundation 
should be 1.5 x the pump weight. This weight is needed to 
get the dampeners to work efficiently at low pump speed. Fig. 2.1.6: Floor

993fbb37-c285-4e46-956a-431784483a3c,"Dampeners
The selection of the right vibration dampener requires 
the following data:
• Forces acting on the dampener
• Motor speed considering speed control, if any
• Required dampening in % (suggested value is 70%)
The determination of the right dampener varies from 
installation to installation but a wrong selection of 
dampener may increase the vibration level in certain cases. 
The supplier should therefore size vibration dampeners.
Pumps installed with vibration dampeners must always 
have expansion joints fitted at both the suction and the 
discharge side. This is important in order to avoid that the 
pump hangs in the flanges. 
Expansion joints
Expansion joints are installed to:
• absorb expansions/contractions in the pipework   
 caused by changing liquid temperature
• reduce mechanical strains in connection with pressure   
 waves in the pipework
• isolate mechanical noise in the pipework (not for metal  
 bellows expansion joints)
Expansion joints must not be installed to compensate for 
inaccuracies in the pipework, such as centre displacement 
or misalignment of flanges.
  
Expansion joints are fitted at a distance of minimum 1 to 
1.5 . DN diameter from the pump on the suction side as well 
as on the discharge side. This prevents the development of 
turbulence in the expansion joints, resulting in better suction 
conditions and a minimum pressure loss on the pressure 
side. At high water velocities (>5 m/s) it is best  to install 
larger expansion joints corresponding to the pipework.Fig. 2.1.11: Installation with expansion joints, vibration dampeners and

expansion joints with or without tie bars.
Expansion joints with tie bars can be used to minimise the 
forces caused by the expansion joints. Expansion joints 
with tie bars are recommended for sizes larger than DN 100.  
An expansion joint without tie bars will exert force on 
the pump flanges. These forces affect the pump and the 
pipework.
The pipes must be fixed so that they do not stress the 
expansion joints and the pump, see figure 2.1.11. The fix 
points should always be placed as close to the expansion 
joints as possible. Follow the expansion joint supplier’s 
instructions.
At temperatures above 100°C combined with a high pressure,  
metal bellows expansion joints are often preferred due to 
the risk of rupture. 
2.1.5 Sound level (L)
The sound level in a system is measured in decibel (dB). 
Noise is unwanted sound. The level of noise can be 
measured in the following three ways: 
 1. Pressure – Lp : The pressure of the air waves
 2. Power – LW : The power of the sound
 3. Intensity - LI: The power per m2 (will not be 
     covered in this book)
It is not possible to compare the three values directly, but it 
is possible to calculate between them based on standards.

8532f5e2-3fe3-4bd8-bee6-af52d9d03124,"The EU Machine Directive prescribes that sound levels 
have to be indicated as pressure when they are below 85 
dB(A) and as power when they exceed 85 dB(A).
Noise is subjective and depends on a person´s ability 
to hear, e.g. young vs. old person. Therefore, the above-
mentioned measurements get weight according to 
the sensibility of a standard ear, see figure 2.1.15. The 
weighting is known as A-weighting (dB(A)), expressed as 
e.g: LpA, and the measurements are adjusted depending on 
frequency. In some cases it increases and in other cases it 
decreases, see figure 2.1.16. Other weightings are known 
as B and C but they are used for other purposes, which we 
do not cover in this book.
In case of two or more pumps in operation, the sound level 
can be calculated. If it is pumps with the same sound level 
the total sound level can be calculated adding the value 
from figure 2.1.17, e.g. 2 . pumps is Lp + 3 dB, 3 . pumps is 
Lp + 5 dB. If the pumps have different sound level, values 
from figure 2.1.18 can be added.
Indications of sound level should normally be stated as 
free field conditions over reflecting surface, meaning the 
sound level on a hard floor with no walls. Guaranteeing 
values in a specific room in a specific pipe system is 
difficult because these values are beyond the reach of the 
manufacturer. Certain conditions could have a negative 
impact (increasing sound level) or a positive impact 
on the sound level. Recommendations to installation 
and foundation can be given to eliminate or reduce the 
negative impact.

Pump performance
When you examine a pump, there are several things 
you have to check. Besides checking the pump’s physical 
condition, for instance if it is rusty or makes abnormal 
noise, you have to know a number of values in order to 
be able to tell if the pump performs as it is supposed 
to. On the next pages, we will present three groups of 
values you may need to focus on when you examine a 
pump’s performance: Hydraulic terms, electrical terms, 
mechanical terms and liquid properties.
2.2.1 Hydraulic terms
When you want to examine pump performance, there are 
a number of values you need to know. In this section, we 
will present the most important hydraulic terms: Flow, 
pressure and head.
Flow
Flow is the amount of liquid that passes through a pump 
within a certain period of time. When we deal with 
performance reading, we distinguish between two flow 
parameters: Volume flow and mass flow.
Volume flow (Q)
Volume flow is what we can read from a pump curve or 
put in another way, a pump can move a volume per unit 
of time (measured in m3/h) no matter the density of the 
liquid. When we deal with e.g. water supply, volume flow 
is the most important parameter, because we need the 
pump to deliver a certain volume, e.g. of drinking water 
or water for irrigation.Throughout this book the term flow 
refers to volume flow.
Mass flow (Qm)
Mass flow is the mass, which a pump moves per unit of 
time and is measured in kg/s. The liquid temperature has an 
influence on how big a mass flow the pump can move per unit 
of time since the liquid density changes with the temperature. 
In connection with heating, cooling and air-condition systems, 
the mass flow is an essential value to know, because the mass 
is the carrier of energy (see Heat capacity).Fig. 2.2.1:  Calculation examplesExamples UnitWater

and total pressure. The total pressure is the sum of the 
static pressure and the dynamic pressure:

The dynamic pressure pdyn is caused by liquid velocity. 
Dynamic pressure cannot be measured by a normal pressure 
gauge, but is calculated by the following formula:
1
2
1
2where:
ρ is the density of the liquid in [kg/m3]
v is the velocity of the liquid in [m/s]
Dynamic pressure can be converted into static pressure 
by reducing the liquid velocity and vice versa. Figure 2.2.3 
shows a part of a system where the pipe diameter increases 
from D1 to D2, resulting in a decrease in liquid speed from v1 
to v2.  Assuming that there is no friction loss in the system, 
the sum of the static pressure and the dynamic pressure is 
constant throughout the horizontal pipe. 1

2
So, an increase in pipe diameter, as the one shown in 
figure 2.2.3 results in an increase in the static head which 
is measured with the pressure gauge p2.
In most pumping systems, the dynamic pressure pdyn has 
a minor impact on the total pressure. For example, if the 
velocity of a water flow is 4.5 m/s, the dynamic pressure is 
around 0.1 bar, which is considered insignificant in many 
pumping systems.  Later on in this chapter, we will discuss 
dynamic pressure in connection with determining the 
head of a pump.  Fig. 2.2.2: How to determine the static pressure psta, the dynamic

Fig. 2.2.5: Pumping four different liquids at 1 bar at the discharge side 
of the pump results in four different heads (m), hence four different 
duty pointsMeasuring pressure
Pressure is measured in e.g. Pa (N/m²), bar (105 Pa) or PSI 
(Ib/in²). When we deal with pressure it is important to know 
the point of reference for the pressure measurement. Two 
types of pressure are essential in connection with pressure 
measurement: Absolute pressure and gauge pressure:
Absolute pressure (pabs)
Absolute pressure is defined as the pressure above 
absolute vacuum, 0 atm, that is the absolute zero for 
pressure. Usually, the value “absolute pressure” is used in 
cavitation calculations. 
Gauge pressure
Gauge pressure, often referred to as overpressure, is the 
pressure, which is higher than the normal atmospheric 
pressure (1 atm). Normally, pressure p is stated as gauge 
pressure, because most sensor and pressure gauge 
measurements measure the pressure difference between 
the system and the atmosphere. Throughout this book the 
term pressure refers to gauge pressure.
Head (H)
The head of a pump is an expression of how high the pump 
can lift a liquid. Head is measured in meter (m) and is 
independent on the liquid density. The following formula 
shows the relation between pressure (p) and head (H):1
2
1
2
where :
H is the head in [m]
p is the pressure in [Pa = N/m2]
ρ is the liquid density in [kg/m3]
g is the acceleration of gravity in [m/s2]
 
Normally, pressure p is measured in [bar], which equals 
105  Pa. However, other pressure units are used as well, see 
figure 2.2.4.
The relation between pressure and head is shown in figure 
2.2.5 where a pump  handles four different liquids. The 
head of the pump depends on the type of liquid. As it 
appears from the figure, the pumping of different liquids 
results in different heads and hence different duty points.

suction and discharge ports How to determine the head  
The pump head is determined by reading the pressure on 
the flanges of the pump p2, p1 and then convert the values 
into head – see figure 2.2.6. However, if a geodetic difference 
in head is present between the two measuring points, as it 
is the case in figure 2.2.6, it is necessary to compensate for 
the difference. Furthermore, if the port dimensions of the 
two measuring points differ from one another the  actual 
head  has to be corrected for this as well.
The actual pump head H is calculated by the following 
formula:1
2
1
2
where :
H is the actual pump head in [m]
p  is the pressure at the flanges in [Pa = N/m2]
ρ  is the liquid density in [kg/m3]
g  is the acceleration of gravity in [m/s2]
h  is the geodetic height in [m]
v  is the liquid velocity in [m/s]
The liquid velocity v is calculated by the following 
formula: 1
2
1
2
where:
v is the velocity in [m/s]
Q is the volume flow in [m3/s]
D is the port diameter in [m]
When combining these two formulas, head H  depends 
on the following factors: The pressure measurements 
p1 and p2, the difference in geodetic height between the 
measuring points (h2-h1), the flow through the pump Q 
and the diameter of the two  ports D1 and D2 .1

The correction due to the difference in port diameter is 
caused by the difference in the dynamic pressure. Instead of 
calculating the correction from the formula, the contribution 
can be read in a nomogram, see appendix F .h2 h1v1p1 D1D2v2

Q = 240 m3/h
p1 = 0.5 bar
p2 = 1.1 bar
Liquid: Water at 200C
Suction port diameter D1 = 150 mm 
Discharge port diameter D2 = 125 mm.  
The difference in height between the two ports where the 
pressure gauges are installed is h2-h1 = 355 mm. 
We are now able to calculate the head of the pump:        
As it appears from the calculation, the pressure difference 
measured by pressure gauges is about 1.1 m lower than 
what the pump is actually performing. This calls for an 
explanation. First, the deviation is caused by the difference 
in height between the pressure gauges (0.36 m) and 
second, it is caused by the difference in port dimensions,  
which in this case is 0.77 m.Fig. 2.2.7: Standard end-suction pump with different

Differential pressure (∆p) 
The differential pressure is the pressure difference 
between the pressures measured at two points, e.g. the 
pressure drops across valves in a system. Differential 
pressure is measured in the same units as pressure. 
System pressure
The system pressure is the static pressure, which is present 
at a point in the system, when the pumps are not running. 
System pressure is important to consider when you deal 
with a closed system. The system pressure in (m) Hsta in 
the lowest point must always be higher than the height of 
the system in order to ensure that the system is filled with

Cavitation occurs somewhere in a pump when the pressure 
is lower than the vapour pressure of the liquid, see figures 
2.2.9 and 2.2.10.
When the pressure on the suction side drops below 
the vapour pressure of the liquid, (figure 2.2.10 yellow 
dot). small vapour bubbles form. These bubbles collapse 
(implode) when the pressure rises (figure 2.2.10 red dot) 
and releases shock waves. Consequently, impellers can 
be damaged by the energy released. The rate of damage 
to the impeller depends on the properties of the material. 
Stainless steel is more resistant to cavitation than bronze, 
and bronze is more resistant to cavitation than cast iron, 
see section 1.6.3.
Cavitation decreases flow (Q) and head (H), which leads 
to reduced pump performance, see figure 2.2.11. Damage 
due to cavitation is often only detected when the pump 
is dismantled. Furthermore, cavitation results in increased 
noise and vibrations, which can consequently damage 
bearings, shaft seals and weldings.
Calculation of the risk of cavitation    
To avoid cavitation, the following formula is used to 
calculate the maximum suction head:
hmax – Maximum suction head
Hb – Atmospheric pressure at the pump site; this is the 
theoretical maximum suction lift, see figure 2.2.13 
Hf – Friction loss in the suction pipe

NPSH curve at the highest operational flow), see figure

The NPSH value of a pump is determined by testing 
according to ISO 9906 and is made in the following 
way. The suction head is reduced while the flow is kept 
at a constant level. When the differential pressure has 
decreased by 3%, the pressure at the pump’s suction side 
is read; and the NPSH value of the pump is defined. The 
testing is repeated at different flows, which form the basis 
of the NPSH curve in the end.    
Put in another way: When the NPSH curve is reached, the 
level of cavitation is so high that the head of the pump has 
decreased by 3%.

Pumps are made of several components, see ﬁgure 2.2.16. 
The power consumption of the different components is 
designated in the following way:
P1 The power input from the mains or, put in another
 way, the amount of power the consumer has to 
 pay for
P2 The power input to the pump or the power output 
 from the motor. Often referred to as shaft power
PH Hydraulic power – the power that the pump 
 transfers to the liquid in the shape of flow 
 and head 
For the most common pump types, the term power
consumption normally refers to P2. Power is measured 
in W, kW.
Efﬁciency in connection with pumps normally only covers 
the efﬁciency of the pump part ηP. A pump’s efﬁciency is 
determined by several factors, for instance the shape of 
the pump housing, the impeller and diffuser design and 
the surface roughness. For typical pump units consisting of 
both pump and electric motor, the total efﬁciency ηT also 
includes the efﬁciency of the motor:
If a frequency converter is included as well, the efﬁciency 
of the entire unit also has to incorporate the efﬁciency of 
the frequency converter:

c18470d1-b343-4905-9eb9-ef57e444fd5f,"Voltage (U)
Like pressure drives flow through a hydraulic system, 
voltage drives a current (I) through an electrical circuit. 
Voltage is measured in volts (V) and can be either direct 
current (DC), e.g. 1.5 V battery – or alternating current (AC), 
e.g. electricity supply for houses, etc. Normally, pumps are 
supplied with AC voltage supply.
The layout of AC mains supply differs from one country to 
another. However, the most common layout is four wires 
with three phases (L1, L2, L3) and a neutral (N). Besides 
these four wires, a protective earth connection (PE) is 
added to the system as well, see figure 2.2.17.
For a 3x400 V/230 V mains supply, the voltage between 
any two of the phases (L1, L2, L3) is 400 V. The voltage 
between one of the phases and neutral (N) is 230 V.
The ratio between the phase-phase voltage and the phase-
neutral voltage is determined by the formula on your 
right:
Current is the flow of electricity and is measured in ampere 
(A). The amount of current in an electrical circuit depends 
on the supplied voltage and the resistance/ impedance in 
the electrical circuit.
Power (P) and power factor (cos ϕ or PF)
Power consumption is indeed of high importance when 
it comes to pumps. For pumps with standard AC motors, 
the power input is found by measuring the input voltage 
and input current and by reading the value cos ϕ on the 
motor/pump nameplate. cos ϕ is the phase angle between 
voltage and current. cos ϕ is also referred to as power factor 
(PF). The power consumption P1 can be calculated by the 
formulas shown on your right depending on whether the 
motor is a single-phase or a three-phase motor.  L1

When you are making your system calculations, there are 
three properties you might need to know about the liquid 
in order to make the right calculations: Liquid temperature,  
density, and heat capacity.
The liquid temperature is measured in °C (Celcius), K 
(Kelvin), or °F (Fahrenheit). °C and K are actually the 
same unit but 0°C is the freezing point of water and 0K 
is the absolute zero, that is -273.15°C - the lowest possible 
temperature. The calculation between Fahrenheit and 
Celcius is: °F = °C . 1.8 + 32, hence the freezing point of 
water is 0°C and 32°F and the boiling point is 100°C and 
212°F.
   
The density is measured in kg/m3 or kg/dm3. 
The heat capacity tells us how much additional energy a 
liquid can contain per mass when it is heated. Liquid heat 
capacity depends on temperature, see figure 2.2.18. This is 
used in systems for transporting energy, e.g. heating, air-
con and cooling. Mixed liquids, e.g. glycol and  water for 
air-con have a lower heat capacity than pure water hence 
higher flow is required to transport the same amount of 
energy.

System characteristics
Previously, in section 1.1.2 we discussed the basic 
characteristics of pump performance curves. In this 
chapter we will examine the pump performance curve at 
different operating conditions as well as a typical system 
characteristic. Finally, we will focus on the interaction 
between a pump and a system.
A system’s characteristic describes the relation between the 
flow Q and head  H in the system. The system characteristic 
depends on the type of system in question. We distinguish 
between two types:  Closed and open systems.
• Closed systems 
are circulating systems like heating or air-conditioning 
systems, where the pump has to overcome the friction 
losses in the pipes, fittings, valves, etc. in the system. 
• Open systems 
are liquid transport systems like water supply systems. In 
such systems the pump has to deal with both the static 
head and overcome the friction losses in the pipes and 
components.
When the system characteristic is drawn in the same 
system of co-ordinates as the pump curve, the duty point 
of the pump can be determined as the point of intersection 
of the two curves, see figure.3.1.1.
Open and closed systems consist of resistances (valves, 
pipes, heat exchanger, etc.) connected in series or 
parallel, which altogether affect the system characteristic. 
Therefore, before we continue our discussion on open 
and closed systems, we will briefly describe how these 
resistances affect the system characteristic.  Fig. 3.1.1: The point of intersection between the pump curve and the system 
characteristic is the duty point of the pump

c6159815-786d-4909-8be4-ff4a11b82b74,"3.1.1 Single resistances
Every component in a system constitutes a resistance 
against the liquid flow which leads to a head loss across 
every single component in the system. The following 
formula is used to calculate the head loss ∆H:
∆H = k . Q2
k is a constant, which depends on the component in 
question and Q is the flow through the component. As it 
appears from the formula, the head loss is proportional to 
the flow in second power. So, if it is possible to lower the 
flow in a system, a substantial reduction in the pressure 
loss occurs.
Resistances connected in series 
The total head loss in a system consisting of several 
components connected in series is the sum of head losses 
that each component represents.  Figure 3.1.2 shows a 
system consisting of a valve and a heat exchanger. If we 
do not consider the head loss in the piping between the 
two components, the total head loss ∆Htot  is calculated by 
adding the two head losses:
∆Htot = ∆H1 + ∆H2
Furthermore, figure 3.1.2 shows how the resulting curve 
will look and what the duty point will be if the system 
is a closed system with only these two components. As 
it appears from the figure, the resulting characteristic 
is found by adding the individual head losses ∆H at a 
given flow Q.  Likewise, the figure shows that the more 
resistance in the system, the steeper the resulting system 
curve will be.

Contrary to connecting components in series, connecting 
components in parallel result in a more flat system 
characteristic. The reason is that components installed 
in parallel reduce the total resistance in the system and 
thereby the head loss. 
The differential pressure across the components connected 
in parallel is always the same. The resulting system 
characteristic is defined by adding all the components’ 
individual flow rate for a specific ∆H. Figure 3.1.3 shows 
a system with a valve and a heat exchanger connected in 
parallel. 
The resulting flow can be calculated by the following 
formula for a head loss equivalent to ∆H 
Q tot = Q 1 + Q2
3.1.2 Closed and open systems
As mentioned previously, pump systems are split into two 
types of basic systems: Closed and open systems. In this 
section, we will examine the basic characteristics of these 
systems. 
Closed systems
Typically, closed systems are systems, which transport 
heat energy in heating systems, air-conditioning systems, 
process cooling systems, etc. A common feature of these 
types of closed systems is that the liquid is circulated and 
is the carrier of heat energy. Heat energy is in fact what the 
system has to transport.
Closed systems are characterised as systems with pumps 
that only have to overcome the sum of friction losses, 
which are generated by all the components. Figure 3.1.4 
shows a schematic drawing of a closed system where 
a pump has to circulate water from a heater through a 
control valve to a heat exchanger. Fig. 3.1.3: Components connected in parallel reduce the resistance in 
the system and result in a more flat system characteristic

4f5dfc39-ad57-4630-abc0-bba5198f48ef,"All these components together with the pipes and fittings 
result in a system characteristic as the one shown in figure 
3.1.5.  The required pressure in a closed system (which the 
system curve illustrates) is a parabola starting in the point 
(Q,H) = (0,0) and is calculated by the following formula:
H = k . Q2
As the formula and curve indicate, the pressure loss is 
approaching zero when the flow drops.
Open systems
Open systems are systems, where the pump is used to 
transport liquid from one point to another, e.g. water 
supply systems, irrigation systems, industrial process 
systems. In such systems the pump has to deal with 
both the geodetic  head of the liquid and to overcome the 
friction losses in the pipes and the system components.
We distinguish between two types of open system:
• Open systems where the total required geodetic lift    
 is positive.
• Open systems where the total required geodetic lift    
 is negative.
Open system with positive geodetic  head  Figure 
3.1.6 shows a typical open system with positive geodetic 
lift. A pump has to transport water from a break tank at 
ground level up to a roof tank on the top of a building. 
First of all, the pump has to provide a head higher than 
the geodetic head of the water (h). Secondly, the pump 
has to provide the necessary head to overcome the total 
friction loss between the two tanks in piping, fittings, 
valves, etc. (Hf). The pressure loss depends on the amount 
of flow, see figure 3.1.7. Fig. 3.1.5: The system characteristic for a closed system is a 
parabola starting in point (0,0)

317ccc99-0eb3-4f8c-814b-fddc3a072783,"The figure shows that in an open system no water flows 
if the maximum head (Hmax) of the pump is lower than 
the geodetic  head (h). Only when H > h, water will start 
to flow from the break tank to the roof tank. The system 
curve also shows that the lower the flow rate, the lower 
the friction loss (Hf) and consequently the lower the power 
consumption of the pump.
So, the flow (Q1) and the pump size have to match the 
need for the specific system. This is in fact a rule-of-
thumb for liquid transport systems: A larger flow leads 
to a higher pressure loss, whereas a smaller flow leads to 
a smaller pressure loss and consequently a lower energy 
consumption.
Open system with negative geodetic  lift 
A typical example of an open system with negative 
required head is a pressure booster system, e.g. in a water 
supply system. The geodetic  head (h) from the water tank 
brings water to the consumer - the water flows, although 
the pump is not running. The difference in height between 
the liquid level in the tank and the altitude of the water 
outlet (h) results in a flow equivalent to Qo. However, the 
head is insufficient to ensure the required flow (Q1) to the 
consumer. Therefore, the pump has to boost the head to 
the level (H1) in order to compensate for the friction loss 
(Hf) in the system . The system is shown in figure 3.1.8 
and the system characteristic together with the pump 
performance curve are shown in figure 3.1.9.
The resulting system characteristic is a parabolic curve 
starting at the H-axes in the point (0,-h). 
The flow in the system depends on the liquid level in the 
tank. If we reduce the water level in the tank the height (h) 
is reduced. This results in a modified system characteristic 
and a reduced flow in the system, see figure 3.1.9.Fig. 3.1.8: Open system with negative geodetic lift

13f1ea80-4402-4dd1-ac4c-8b9aa05c6241,"To extend the total pump performance in a system, pumps 
are often connected in series or parallel. In this section we 
will concentrate on these two ways of connecting pumps.
 
3.2.1 Pumps in parallel
Pumps connected in parallel are often used when 
• the required flow is higher than what one single pump  
 can supply
• the system has variable flow requirements and when   
 these requirements are met by switching the parallel-  
 connected pumps on and off. 
Normally, pumps connected in parallel are of similar type 
and size. However, the pumps can be of different size, or 
one or several pumps can be speed-controlled and thereby 
have different performance curves.
 
To avoid bypass circulation in pumps, which are not 
running, a non-return valve is connected in series with 
each of the pumps. The resulting performance curve 
for a system consisting of several pumps in parallel is 
determined by adding the flow, which the pumps deliver 
at a specific head. 
Figure 3.2.1 shows a system with two identical pumps 
connected in parallel. The system’s total performance 
curve is determined by adding Q1 and Q2 for every value of 
head which is the same for both pumps, H1=H2 . 
Because the pumps are identical the resulting pump curve 
has the same maximum head Hmax but the maximum flow 
Qmax is twice as big. For each value of head the flow is the 
double as for a single pump in operation: 
Q = Q1 + Q2 = 2 Q1 = 2 Q2Fig. 3.2.1: Two pumps connected in parallel with similar 
performance curves

4455b5d8-8a34-4b2f-bc77-83b75b022426,"Figure 3.2.2 shows two different sized pumps connected in 
parallel. When adding Q1 and Q2 for a given head H1=H2, the 
resulting performance curve is defined. The hatched area 
in figure 3.2.2 shows that P1 is the only pump to supply in 
that specific area, because it has a higher maximum head 
than P2. 
Speed-controlled pumps connected in parallel
The combination of pumps connected in parallel and 
speed-controlled pumps is a very useful way to achieve 
efficient pump performance when the flow demand varies. 
The method is common in connection with water supply / 
pressure boosting systems. Later in chapter 4, we will 
discuss speed-controlled pumps in detail. 
A pumping system consisting of two speed-controlled 
pumps with the same performance curve covers a wide 
performance range, see figure 3.2.3. 
One single pump is able to cover the required pump 
performance up until Q1. Above Q1 both pumps have to 
operate to meet the performance needed. If both pumps 
are running at the same speed the resulting pump curves 
look like the orange curves shown in figure 3.2.3. 
Please note that the duty point indicated at Q1 is obtained 
with one pump running at full speed. However, the 
duty point can also be achieved when two pumps are 
running at reduced speed. This situation is shown in figure 
3.2.4 (orange curves). The figure also compares the two 
situations with regard to efficiency. The duty point for 
one single pump running at full speed results  in a bad 
pump efficiency mainly because the duty point is located 
far out on the pump curve. The total efficiency is much 
higher when two pumps run at reduced speed, although 
the maximum efficiency of the pumps decreases slightly 
at reduced speed. 
Even though one single pump is able to maintain the 
required flow and head, it is sometimes necessary due 
to efficiency and thus energy consumption to use both 
pumps at the same time. Whether to run one or two 
pumps depend on the actual system characteristic and the 
pump type in question.Fig 3.2.2: Two pumps connected in parallel with unequal 
performance curves

aa9c83e9-3b49-4fe1-89f4-04d0fdfc7c19,"3.2.2. Pumps connected in series 
Normally, pumps connected in series are used in 
systems where a high pressure is required. This is also 
the case for multistage pumps which are based on the 
series principle, i.e. one stage equals one pump. Figure 
3.2.5 shows the performance curve of two identical 
pumps connected in series. The resulting performance 
curve is made by marking the double head for each 
flow value in the system of co-ordinates. This results 
in a curve with the double maximum head (2 ⋅Hmax) and 
the same maximum flow (Qmax) as each of the single 
pumps.
Figure 3.2.6 shows two different sized pumps connected 
in series. The resulting performance curve is found by 
adding H1 and H2 at a given common flow Q1=Q2. 
The hatched area in figure 3.2.6 shows that P2 is the 
only pump to supply in that specific area because it has 
a higher maximum flow than P1.
 As discussed in section 3.2.1, unequal pumps can be 
a combination of different sized pumps or of one or 
several speed-controlled pumps. The combination of 
a fixed speed pump and a speed-controlled pump 
connected in series is often used in systems where a 
high and constant pressure is required. The fixed speed 
pump supplies the liquid to the speed-controlled pump, 
whose output is controlled by a pressure transmitter 
PT, see figure 3.2.7.Fig. 3.2.5: Two equal sized pumps connected in series

Adjusting pump performance
When selecting a pump for a given application it is 
important to choose one where the duty point is in the 
high-efficiency area of the pump. Otherwise, the power 
consumption of the pump is unnecessarily high – see figure 
4.1.1. 
However, sometimes it is not possible to select a pump that 
fits the optimum duty point because the requirements of 
the system change or the system curve changes over time.
Therefore, it can be necessary to adjust the pump 
performance so that it meets the changed requirements.
The most common methods of changing pump 
performance are:
• Throttle control
• Bypass control
• Modifying impeller diameter
• Speed control
Choosing a method of adjusting the pump performance is 
based on an evaluation of the initial investment together 
with the operating costs of the pump. All methods can be 
carried out continuously during operation apart from the 
modifying impeller diameter–method. Often, oversized 
pumps are selected for the system and therefore it is 
necessary to limit the performance – first of all, the flow 
rate and in some applications the maximum head. 
On the following pages you can read about the four 
adjusting methods. Fig.: 4.1.1: When selecting a pump it is important to choose a pump 
where the duty point is within the high efﬁciency area.H[m]

a92624af-e8a0-4a12-9fc2-05983d43f6d8,"5xx4.1.1 Throttle control
A throttle valve is placed in series with the pump making it 
possible to adjust the duty point. The throttling results in a 
reduction of flow, see figure 4.1.2. The throttle valve adds 
resistance to the system and raises  the system curve to a 
higher position. Without the throttle valve, the flow is Q2. 
With the throttle valve connected in series with the pump, 
the flow is reduced to Q1.
Throttle valves can be used to limit the maximum flow. By 
adding the valve, the maximum possible flow in the system 
is limited. In the example, the flow will never be higher than 
Q3, even if the system curve is completely flat – meaning no 
resistance at all in the system.  When the pump performance 
is adjusted by the throttling method, the pump will deliver a 
higher head than necessary for that particular system.  
If the pump and the throttle valve are replaced by a smaller 
pump, the pump will be able to meet the wanted flow Q1,  
but at a lower pump head and consequently a lower power 
consumption, see ﬁgure 4.1.2.
4.1.2 Bypass control
Instead of connecting a valve in series with the pump, a 
bypass valve across the pump can be used to adjust the 
pump performance, see figure 4.1.3. 
Compared to the throttle valve, installing a bypass valve 
will result in a certain minimum flow QBP in the pump,  
independent on  the system characteristics. The flow  QP  is 
the sum of the flow in the system QS and the flow in the 
bypass valve QBP.  
 
The bypass valve will introduce a maximum limit of head 
supplied to the system Hmax , see figure 4.1.3. Even when 
the required flow in the system is zero, the pump will never 
run against a closed valve. Like it was in the case with 
the throttling valve, the required flow QS can be met by a 
smaller pump and no bypass valve; the result being a lower 
flow and consequently a lower energy consumption.Fig.: 4.1.2: The throttle valve increases the resistance in the system  
and consequently reduces the ﬂow.H

4.1.3 Modifying impeller diameter
Another way of adjusting the performance of a centrifugal 
pump is by modifying the impeller diameter in the pump  
meaning, reducing the diameter and consequently 
reducing the pump performance. 
Obviously, reducing the impeller diameter cannot be 
done while the pump is operating. Compared to the 
throttling and bypass methods, which can be carried out 
during operation, modifying the impeller diameter has 
to be done in advance before the pump is installed or in 
connection with service. The following formulas show the 
relation between the impeller diameter and the pump 
performance:
 
Please note that the formulas are an expression of an 
ideal pump. In practice, the pump efficiency decreases 
when the impeller diameter is reduced. For minor changes 
of the impeller diameter Dx > 0.8 . Dn, the efficiency is 
only reduced by a few %-points. The degree of efficiency 
reduction depends on pump type and duty point (check 
specific pump curves for details).
As it appears from the formulas, the flow and the head 
change with the same ratio – that is the ratio change 
of the impeller diameter in second power. The duty 
points following the formulas are placed on a straight 
line starting in (0,0). The change in power consumption 
is following the diameter change in fourth power.
4.1.4 Speed control
The last method of controlling the pump performance 
that we will cover in this section is the variable speed 
control method. Speed control by means of a frequency 
converter is without no doubt the most efficient way of 
adjusting pump performance exposed to variable flow 
requirements.

The following equations apply with close approximation to 
how the change of speed of centrifugal pumps influences 
the performance of the pump:
The affinity laws apply on condition that the system 
characteristic remains unchanged for nn and nx and  forms 
a parabola through (0,0) – see section 3.1.1.  The power 
equation furthermore implies that the pump efficiency is 
unchanged at the two speeds. 
The formulas in figure 4.1.5 show that the pump flow (Q) 
is proportional to the pump speed (n). The head (H) is 
proportional to the second power of the speed (n) whereas 
the power (P) is proportional to the third power of the 
speed. In practice, a reduction of the speed will result in a 
slight fall in efficiency.  The efficiency at reduced speed (nx) 
can be estimated by the following formula, which is valid 
for speed reduction down to 50% of the maximum speed:
 
Finally, if you need to know precisely how much power you 
can save by reducing the pump speed, you have to take the 
efficiency of the frequency converter and the motor into 
account.

Now that we have described the four different ways of 
changing the performance of a centrifugal pump, we will 
have a look at how they differ from one another. 
When we consider the pump and its performance-changing 
device as one unit,  we can observe the resulting QH-
characteristic of this device and compare the result of the 
different systems.
Throttle control
The throttling method implies a valve connected in series 
with a pump, see figure 4.1.6a. This connection acts as 
a new pump at unchanged maximum head but reduced 
flow performance. The pump curve Hn, the valve curve and 
the curve covering the complete system - Hx, see figure 
4.1.6b.
Bypass control
When a valve is connected across the pump, see figure 4.1.7a, 
this connection acts as a new pump at reduced maximum 
head and a QH-curve with a changed characteristic. The 
curve will tend to be more linear than quadratic, see figure 
4.1.7b
Modifying impeller diameter
The impeller reducing method does not imply any extra 
components. Figure 4.1.8 shows the reduced QH-curve (Hx) 
and the original curve characteristics (Hn).
Speed control
The speed control method (figure 1.4.9) results in a 
new QH-curve at reduced head and flow. The characteristics 
of the curves remain the same. However, when speed 
is reduced the curves become more flat, as the head is 
reduced to a higher degree than the flow.
Compared to the other methods the speed control 
method also makes it possible to extend the performance 
range of the pump above the nominal QH-curve, simply 
by increasing the speed above nominal speed level of 
the pump, see the Hy-curve in figure 4.1.9. If this over-
synchronous operation is used, the size of the motor has 
to be take into account.Continuous

ea326ca8-1915-4cd7-9f21-6d109c4d48ad,"4.1.6 Overall efficiency of the pump system
Both the throttling and the bypass method introduce some 
hydraulic power losses in the valves (Ploss = k Q H).  Therefore, 
the resulting efficiency of the pumping system is reduced.
Reducing the impeller size in the range of Dx/Dn>0.8 
does not have a significant impact on the pump 
efficiency. Therefore, this method does not have a 
negative influence on the overall efficiency of the system. 
The efficiency of speed-controlled pumps is only affected 
to a limited extent, as long as the speed reduction does 
not drop below 50% of the nominal speed. Later on, we 
will discover that the efficiency has only reduced a few %-
points, and that it does not have an impact on the overall 
running economy of speed-controlled solutions.
4.1.7 Example: Relative power consumption  
when the flow is reduced by 20%  
In an given installation the flow has to be reduced from 
Q = 60 m3/h to 50 m3/h. In the original starting point 
(Q = 60 m3/h and H = 70 m), the power input to the 
pump is set relatively to 100%. Depending on the method 
of performance adjustment, the power consumption 
reduction will vary. Now, let us have a look at how 
the power consumption affects each of the performance 
adjustment methods.

The power consumption is reduced to about 94% when 
the flow drops. The throttling results in an increased head, 
see figure 4.1.10.  The maximum power consumption is for 
some pumps at a lower flow than the maximum flow.  If 
this is the case, the power consumption increases because 
of the throttle. 
Bypass control
To reduce the flow in the system, the valve has to reduce 
the head of the pump to 55 m. This can only be done by 
increasing the flow in the pump. As it appears from figure 
4.1.11, the flow is consequently increased to 81 m3/h, which 
results in an increased power consumption of up to 10% 
above the original consumption. The degree of increase 
depends on the pump type and the duty point. Therefore, 
in some cases, the increase in P2 is equal to zero and in a 
few rare cases P2 might even decrease a little.
Modifying impeller diameter
When the impeller diameter is reduced, both the flow and 
the head of the pump drop.  By a flow reduction of 20%, 
the power consumption is reduced to around 67% of its 
original consumption, see figure 4.1.12.
Speed control 
When the speed of the pump is controlled, both the flow 
and the head are reduced, see figure 4.1.13. Consequently, 
the power consumption has  reduced to around 65%  of the 
original consumption.
 
When it comes to obtaining the best possible efficiency, the 
impeller diameter adjustment method or the speed control 
method of the pump are the best suited for reducing the 
flow in the installation . When the pump has to operate 
in a fixed, modified duty point, the impeller diameter 
adjustment method is the best solution. However, when 
we deal with an installation, where the flow demand 
varies, the speed-controlled pump is the best solution.H [m]

Fig.  4.1.14: Characteristics of adjustment methods.Summary
Figure 4.1.14 gives an overview of the different adjustment 
methods that we have presented in the previous section.

into account when choosing an adjustment method for a 
system.

cecdcdf9-cd42-4f51-adc7-5a4c2ddf3577,"As discussed in the previous section, speed control of pumps 
is an efficient way of adjusting pump performance to the 
system. In this section we will discuss the possibilities of 
combining speed-controlled pumps with PI-controllers 
and sensors measuring system parameters, such as 
pressure, differential pressure and temperature. On the 
following pages, the different options will be presented 
by examples.
4.2.1 Constant pressure control
A pump has to supply tap water from a break tank to 
different taps in a building.
 
The demand for tap water is varying, so therefore the 
system characteristic varies according to the required 
flow. Due to comfort and energy savings a constant supply 
pressure is recommended.
As it appears from figure 4.2.1, the solution is a speed- 
controlled pump with a PI-controller. The PI-controller 
compares the needed pressure pset with the actual supply 
pressure p1, measured by a pressure transmitter PT. 
If the actual pressure is higher than the setpoint, the 
PI-controller reduces the speed and consequently the 
performance of the pump, until p1 = pset. Figure 4.2.1 shows 
what happens when the flow is reduced from Qmax to Q1 .
The controller sees to it that the speed of the pump is 
reduced from nn to nx  in order to ensure that the required 
discharge pressure is p1 = pset. The pump installation 
ensures that the supply pressure is constant in the flow 
range of 0 - Qmax. The supply pressure is independent 
on the level (h) in the break tank. If h changes, the PI-
controller adjusts the speed of the pump so that p1 always 
corresponds to the setpoint. H

4e04e128-ef24-4b3e-9b8f-32681a41cf49,"4.2.2 Constant temperature control
Performance adjustment by means of speed control is 
suitable for a number of industrial applications. Figure 4.2.2 
shows a system with an injection moulding machine which 
has to be water-cooled to ensure high quality production.
The machine is cooled with water at 15oC from a cooling 
plant. To ensure that the moulding machine runs properly 
and is cooled sufficiently , the return pipe temperature has 
to be kept at a constant level; tr = 20oC. The solution is a 
speed-controlled pump, controlled by a PI-controller. The 
PI-controller compares the needed temperature tset with 
the actual return pipe temperature tr, which is measured 
by a temperature transmitter TT. This system has a fixed 
system characteristic and therefore the duty point of the 
pump is located on the curve between Qmin and Qmax. The 
higher the heat loss in the machine, the higher the flow 
of cooling water needed to ensure that the return pipe 
temperature is kept at a constant level of 20 oC.
 
4.2.3 Constant differential pressure in a 
circulating system
Circulating systems (closed systems), see chapter 3, are 
well-suited for speed-controlled pump solutions. It is an 
advantage that circulating systems with variable system 
characteristic are fitted with a differential pressure- 
controlled circulator pump, see figure 4.2.3.
The figure shows a heating system consisting of a heat 
exchanger where the circulated water is heated up and 
delivered to three consumers, e.g. radiators, by a speed-
controlled pump. A control valve is connected in series at 
each consumer to control the flow according to the heat 
requirement.
The pump is controlled according to a  constant differential 
pressure, measured across the pump. This means that 
the pump system offers constant differential pressure in 
the Q-range of 0 – Qmax, depicted as the horizontal line in 
figure 4.2.3.Fig.  4.2.2: System with injection moulding machine and temperature- 
controlled circulator pump ensuring a constant return pipe temperature

173d462b-4916-4e27-9a59-eea4e1866eb8,"4.2.4 Flow-compensated differential 
pressure control
The main function of the pumping system in figure 4.2.4 
is to maintain a constant differential pressure across the 
control valves at the consumers, e.g. radiators. In order to 
do so, the pump has to be able to overcome friction losses 
in pipes, heat exchangers, fittings, etc. 
As we discussed in chapter 3, the pressure loss in a system 
is proportional to the flow in second power. The best way 
to control a circulator pump in a system like the one shown 
in the figure on your right, is to allow the pump to deliver a 
pressure, which increases when the flow increases. 
When the demand of flow is low, the pressure losses in the 
pipes, heat exchangers, fittings, etc. are low as well, and 
the pump only supplies a pressure equivalent to what the 
control valve requires, Hset-Hf. When the demand of flow 
increases, the pressure losses increase in second power  
and therefore the pump has to increase the delivered 
pressure; depicted as the blue curve in figure 4.2.4.
Such a pumping system can be designed in two different 
ways:
• The differential pressure transmitter is placed across the 
 pump and the system is running with flow-compensated
 differential pressure control – DPT1, see figure 4.2.4.
• The differential pressure transmitter is placed close to
 the consumers and the system is running with
 differential pressure control – DPT2 in fig. 4.2.4.
The advantage of the first solution is that the pump, the 
PI-controller, the speed control and the transmitter are 
placed close to one another, making the installation easy. 
This installation makes it possible to get the entire system 
as one single unit, see section 4.4. In order to get the 
system up and running, pump curve data have to be stored 
in the controller. These data are used to calculate the flow 
and likewise to calculate how much the setpoint Hset has to be reduced at a given flow to ensure that the pump 
performance meets the required blue curve in figure 4.2.4.
The second solution with the transmitter placed in the 
installation requires more installation costs because the 
transmitter has to be installed at the installation site and 
the necessary cabling has to be carried out as well. The 
performance of this system is more or less similar to the 
first system. The transmitter measures the differential 
pressure at the consumer and compensates automatically 
for the increase in required pressure in order to overcome 
the increase in pressure losses in the supply pipes, etc.Q1QmaxHset

9b628ef4-87e8-47f8-b7b7-03a227d3ee16,"Kapitel 1                5A large number of pump applications do not require full 
pump performance 24 hours a day. Therefore, it is an 
advantage to be able to adjust the pump’s performance 
in the system automatically. As we saw in section 4.1, 
the best possible way of adapting the performance of 
a centrifugal pump is by means of speed control of the 
pump. Speed control of pumps is normally made by a 
frequency converter unit. 
On the following pages we will have a look at speed- 
controlled pumps in closed and open systems. But before 
we dig any further into the world of speed control, we will 
present the advantages that speed control provides and 
the benefits that speed-controlled pumps with frequency 
converter offer.Reduced energy consumption  
Speed-controlled pumps only use the amount of energy 
needed to solve a specific pump job. Compared to other 
control methods, frequency-controlled speed control 
offers the highest efficiency and thus the most efficient 
utilization of the energy, see section 4.1.
Low life cycle costs
As we will see in chapter 5, the energy consumption of a 
pump is a very important factor considering a pump’s life 
cycle costs. Therefore, it is important to keep the operating 
costs of a pumping system at the lowest possible level. 
Efficient operation leads to lower energy consumption and 
thus to lower operating costs. Compared to fixed speed 
pumps, it is possible to reduce the energy consumption by 
up to 50% with a speed-controlled pump. 
Protection of the environment
Energy efficient pumps polute less and thus do not harm 
the environment.
Increased comfort
Speed control in different pumping systems provides 
increased comfort: In water supply systems, automatic 
pressure control and soft-start of pumps reduce water 
hammer and noise generated by too high pressure in the 
system. In circulating systems, speed-controlled pumps 
ensure that the differential pressure is kept at a level so 
that noise in the system is minimised.    
Reduced system costs
Speed-controlled pumps can reduce the need for 
commissioning and control valves in the system. 
Therefore, the total system costs can be reduced.Section 4.3

3c694a9d-633a-4dd2-8d3d-ce5ac1c58b53,"In many applications, pumps with integrated frequency 
converter is the optimum solution. The reason is that these 
pumps combine the benefits of a speed-controlled pump 
solution with the benefits gained from combining a pump, 
a frequency converter, a PI-controller and sometimes 
also a sensor/pressure transmitter in one single unit 
– see figure 4.4.1.  
A pump with integrated frequency converter is not just 
a pump, but a system which is able to solve application 
problems or save energy in a variety of pump installations. 
As regards replacement, pumps with integrated frequency 
converters are ideal as they can be installed instead of 
ﬁxed speed  pumps at no extra installation cost. All that 
is required is a power supply connection and a fitting of 
the pump with integrated frequency converter in the pipe 
system, and then the pump is ready for operation. All 
the installer has to do is to adjust the required setpoint 
(pressure) after which the system is operational.
What follows is a brief description of the advantages that 
pumps with integrated frequency converter have to offer.
Easy to install
Pumps with integrated frequency converter are just as 
easy to install as fixed speed pumps. All you have to do is 
to connect the motor to the electrical power supply and 
the pump is in operation. The manufacturer has made all 
internal connections and adjustments.
Optimal energy savings
Because the pump, the motor and the frequency converter 
are designed for compatibility, operation of the pump 
system reduces power consumption.
One supplier
One supplier can provide pump, frequency converter 
and sensor which naturally facilitate the dimensioning, 
selection, ordering procedures, as well as maintenance 
and service procedures. Fig. 4.4.1:  Pump unit with integrated

Pumps with integrated frequency converter have a 
very broad performance range, which enables them to 
perform efficiently under widely varied conditions and to 
meet a wide range of requirements. Thus, fewer pumps 
can replace many fixed speed pump types with narrow 
performance capabilities.  
4.4.1. Performance curves of speed- 
controlled pumps
Now, let us have a closer look at how you can read a  
speed-controlled  pump’s performance curve.
Figure 4.4.2 shows an example of the performance curves 
of a speed-controlled pump. The ﬁrst curve shows the QH-
curve and the second curve shows the corresponding power 
consumption curve.
As you can tell, the performance curves are given for every 
10% decrease in speed from 100% down to 50%. Likewise, 
the minimum curve represented by 25% of the maximum 
speed is also shown.  As we have indicated in the diagram, 
you can point out a specific duty point QH and ﬁnd out at 
which speed the duty point can be reached and what the 
power consumption P1 is.
4.4.2 Speed-controlled pumps in different 
systems
Speed-controlled pumps are used in a wide range of systems. 
The change in pump performance and consequently the 
potential energy saving depend on the system in question.
As we discussed in chapter 3, the  characteristic of a system 
is an indication of the required head a pump has to deliver, 
in order to transport a certain quantity of liquid through 
the system. Figure 4.4.3 shows the performance curve and 
the system characteristic of a closed and an open system.

In closed systems, like heating and air-conditioning systems, 
the pump has only to overcome the friction losses in the pipes, 
valves, heat exchangers, etc. In this section, we will present 
an example with a speed-controlled pump in a closed 
system.  The total friction loss by a full flow of 15 m3/h is 16 m, 
see figure 4.4.4.
The system characteristic starts in the point (0,0), the red 
line in figure 4.4.5. The control valves in the system always 
need a certain operating pressure, so therefore the pump 
cannot work according to the system characteristic. That is 
why some speed-controlled pumps offer the proportional 
pressure control function, which ensures that the pump 
will operate according to the orange line shown in the 
figure. As you can tell from the figure 4.4.5, the minimum 
performance is around 57% of the full speed. In a circulating 
system operation at the minimum curve (25% of the full 
speed) can be relevant in some situations, for example 
when we deal with night-time duty in heating systems.HQ = 15 m2/h

The system characteristic as well as the operating range of 
the pump depend on the type of system in question.
Figure 4.4.6 shows a pump in a pressure boosting / water 
supply system. The pump has to supply Q = 6.5 m3/h to the 
tap, which is placed h = 20 m above the pump. The inlet 
pressure to the pump ps is 1 bar, the pressure at the tap pt 
has to be 2 bar and the total friction loss in the system by 
full flow pf is 1.3 bar.
Figure 4.4.7 shows the QH-curve of a pump, which is 
able to meet the requirements described before. You can 
calculate the required head at zero flow (Ho) by using the 
equation on your right.
If you need to calculate the maximum head at a flow (Q) of 
6.5 m3/h, this is the equation to use:

Q = 6.5 m3/h the pump operates in a relative narrow speed 
band, that is from about 65% of the full speed and up to 
99% of the full speed. In systems with less friction loss 
the variation in speed will be even smaller. If no friction 
loss, the minimum speed in the above case is about 79% 
speed.
As you can tell from the previous two examples, the 
possible variation in speed and consequently in power 
consumption is highest in closed systems. Therefore, the 
closed systems account for the highest energy saving 
potential.   h = 20 mFig. 4.4.6: Pump in a

d244f5ce-30c4-4557-9c79-aee432128f7d,"4.5.2. Components of the frequency 
converter
In principle, all frequency converters consist of the same 
functional blocks. The basic function is as mentioned 
previously, to convert the mains voltage supply into a new 
AC voltage with another frequency and amplitude. 
The frequency converter first of all rectifies the incoming 
mains voltage and then stores the energy in an intermediate 
circuit consisting of a capacitor. The DC voltage is then 
converted into a new AC voltage with another frequency 
and amplitude.
Because of the intermediate circuit in the frequency 
converter the frequency of the mains voltage has no direct 
influence on the output frequency and thus to the motor 
speed. It does not matter if the frequency is 50Hz or 60Hz 
as the rectifier can handle both situations. Additionally, the 
incoming frequency will not influence the output frequency,  
as this is defined by the voltage/frequency pattern, which 
is defined in the inverter.  Keeping the above-mentioned 
facts in mind, using a frequency converter in connection 
with asynchronous motors provides the following benefits:
• The system can be used in both 50 and 60 cycle   
 areas without any modifications
• The output frequency of the frequency converter is   
 independent on the incoming frequency
• The frequency converter can supply output frequencies   
 higher than mains supply frequency – makes    
   oversynchronous operation possible.
As you can tell from figure 4.5.2, the frequency converter 
consists of three other components as well: An EMC filter, 
a control circuit and an inverter. As mentioned earlier, speed control of pumps involves a 
frequency converter. Therefore, it will be relevant to have 
a closer look at a frequency converter, how it operates and 
finally to discuss related precautions by using this device.
 
4.5.1 Basic function and characteristics
It is a well-known fact that the speed of an asynchronous 
motor depends primarily on the pole number of the motor 
and the frequency of the voltage supplied. The amplitude 
of the voltage supplied and the load on the motor shaft 
also influence the motor speed, however, not to the same 
degree. Consequently, changing the frequency of the 
supply voltage is an ideal method for asynchronous motor 
speed control. In order to ensure a correct motor magnetisation 
it is also necessary to change the amplitude of the voltage.
A frequency/voltage control results in a displacement of the 
torque characteristic whereby the speed is changed. Figure  
4.5.1 shows the motor torque characteristic (T) as a function 
of the speed (n) at two different frequencies/voltages. In 
the same diagram is also drawn the load characteristic 
of the pump. As it appears from the figure, the speed is 
changed by changing frequency/voltage of the motor. 
The frequency converter changes frequency and voltage, 
so therefore we can conclude that the basic task of a 
frequency converter is to change the fixed supply voltage/
frequency, e.g. 3x400 V/ 50Hz, into a variable voltage/
frequency.Fig. 4.5.1:  Displacement of motor torque characteristicn T

This block is not part of the primary function of the 
frequency converter and therefore, in principle, could be left 
out of the frequency converter. However, in order to meet 
the requirements of the EMC directive of the European 
Union or other local requirements, the filter is necessary.
The EMC filter ensures that the frequency converter does 
not send unacceptably high noise signal back to the mains 
thus disturbing other electronic equipment connected to 
the mains. At the same time the filter ensures that noise 
signals in the mains generated by other equipment do not 
enter the electronic devices of the frequency converter 
causing damage or disturbances.
The control circuit
The control circuit block has two functions: It controls the 
frequency converter and at the same time it takes care of 
the entire communication between the product and the 
surroundings.
The inverter
The output voltage from a frequency converter is 
not sinusoidal like the normal mains voltage is. The 
voltage supplied to the motor consists of a number of 
square-wave pulses, see figure 4.5.3. The mean value of 
these pulses forms a sinusoidal voltage of the desired 
frequency and amplitude. The switching frequency can 
be from a few kHz up to 20 kHz, depending on the 
brand. To avoid noise generation in the motor windings, a 
frequency converter with a switching frequency 
above the range of audibility (~16 kHz) is preferable. 
This principle of inverter operation is called PWM (Pulse 
Width Modulation) control and it is the control principle 
which is used most often in frequency converters today.
The motor current itself is almost sinusoidal. This is shown 
in figure 4.5.4 (a) indicating motor current (top) and motor 
voltage. In figure 4.5.4 (b) a section of the motor voltage 
is shown. This indicates how the pulse/pause ratio of the 
voltage changes.t0

864ee84a-f45b-4754-9800-cdeeba25f7ca,"4.5.3 Special conditions regarding 
frequency converters
By installing and using frequency converters or pumps 
with integrated frequency converters, there are some 
conditions, which the installer and user have to be aware 
of. A frequency converter will behave differently at the 
mains supply side than a standard asynchronous motor. 
This is described in detail below.
Non-sinusoidal power input, three-phase supplied 
frequency converters
A frequency converter designed as the one described above 
will not receive sinusoidal current from the mains. Among 
other things this influences the dimensioning of mains 
supply cable, mains switch, etc. Figure 4.5.5 shows how 
mains current and voltage appear for a:
a)  three-phase, two-pole standard asynchronous motor
b) three-phase, two-pole standard asynchronous motor 
with frequency converter.
In both cases the motor supplies 3 kW to the shaft.
A comparison of the current in the two cases shows the 
following differences, see ﬁgure 4.5.6:
• The current for the system with frequency converter 
 is not sinusoidal
• The peak current is much higher (approx. 52%    
 higher) for the frequency converter solution
This is due to the design of the frequency converter 
connecting the mains to a rectifier followed by a capacitor. 
The charging of the capacitor happens during short time 
periods in which the rectified voltage is higher than the 
voltage in the capacitor at that moment. 
As mentioned above, the non-sinusoidal current results in 
other conditions at the mains supply side of the motor. For a 
standard motor without a frequency converter the relation 
between voltage (U), current (I) and power (P) is shown 
in the box on your right hand side. The same formula 
cannot be used for the calculation of the power input in 
connection with motors with frequency converters. Fig 4.5.5 a): Three-phase, two-pole 
standard asynchronous motorFig 4.5.5 b): Three-phase, two-pole

9a1cf6e1-0e1e-426a-8b3e-9222e0949f35,"In fact, in this case, there is no safeway of calculating 
the power input based on simple current and voltage 
measurements, as these are not sinusoidal. Instead, the 
power must be calculated by means of instruments and 
on the basis of instantaneous measurements of current 
and voltage.
If the power (P) is known as well as the RMS value of 
current and voltage, the so-called power factor (PF) can be 
calculated by the formula on your right hand side.
Unlike what is the case when current and voltage are 
sinusoidal, the power factor has no direct connection 
with the way in which current and voltage are displaced 
in time. 
When measuring the input current in connection with 
installation and service of a system with frequency 
converter it is necessary to use an instrument that is capable 
of measuring “non-sinusoidal” currents. In general, current 
measuring instruments for frequency converters must be 
of a type measuring “True RMS”.
Frequency converters and earth-leakage circuit 
breakers (ELCB)
Earth-leakage circuit breakers are used increasingly as 
extra protection in electrical installations. If a frequency 
converter is to be connected to such an installation it 
must be ensured that the ELCB installed is of a type 
which will surely brake - also if failure occurs on the 
DC side of the frequency converter. In order to be sure 
that the ELCB always will brake in case of earth-leakage 
current the ELCB’s to be used in connection with frequency 
converter must be labelled with the signs shown in 
figures 4.5.7 and 4.5.8
Both types of earth-leakage circuit breaker are available in 
the market today.Fig 4.5.7: Labelling of the ELCB for single-phase frequency converters

Life cycle costs equation
In this section we will focus on the elements that make up
a pump’s life cycle costs (LCC) in order to understand what 
LCC is, which factors to consider when we calculate it and 
how to calculate it. Finally, we will illustrate the notion life 
cycle costs by an example. But before we dig any further 
into life cycle costs, we need to understand what the notion 
covers. 
The Hydraulic Institute, Europump and the US Department 
of Energy have elaborated a tool called the Pump Life cycle 
costs (LCC), see figure 5.1.1. The tool is designed to help 
companies minimise the waste and maximise the energy 
efficiency in different systems including pumping systems.  
Life cycle cost calculations are a decision-making tool that 
can be used in connection with design of new installations 
or repair of existing installations. 
The life cycle costs (LCC) consist of the following elements:
Cic Initial costs, purchase price
Cin Installation and commissioning costs
Ce Energy costs
Co Operating costs (labour costs)
Cemv Environmental costs
Cm Maintenance and repair costs
Cs Downtime costs (loss of production)
Cd Decommissioning/disposal costs
In the following paragraphs, each of these elements is 
described.  As it appears from figure 5.1.2, the energy costs, 
initial costs and maintenance costs are the most important. Fig. 5.1.2: Typical life cycle costs of a circulating 
system in the industryTypical life cycle costs

Energy costs
The life cycle costs of a pump is an expression of how 
much it costs to purchase, install, operate, maintain 
and dispose of a pump during its lifetime.
Fig. 5.1.1: A guide to life cycle costs analysis for pumping systems
LCC is calculated by the following formula:
LCC = Cic + Cin + Ce + Co + Cm + Cs + Cemv + Cd

dc4bfd21-3328-4331-9cc9-cd0157ea5d0a,"5.1.1 Initial costs, purchase price (Cic)
The initial costs (Cic) of a pump system includes all 
equipment and accessories necessary to operate the 
system, e.g pumps, frequency converters, control panels 
and transmitters, see figure 5.1.3.
Often, there is a trade-off between the initial costs and 
the energy and maintenance costs. Thus, in many cases 
expensive components have a longer lifetime or a lower 
energy consumption than inexpensive components have. 
5.1.2 Installation and commissioning costs 
(Cin)
The installation and commissioning costs include the 
following costs:
• Installation of the pumps
• Foundation
• Connection of electrical wiring and instrumentation
• Installation, connection and set-up of transmitters, 
 frequency converters, etc.
• Commissioning evaluation at start-up
As was the case for the initial costs, it is important to check the 
trade-off options. In connection with pumps with integrated 
frequency converter , many of the components are already 
integrated in the product. Therefore, this kind of pump is 
often subject to higher initial costs and lower installation and 
commissioning costs.   Fig. 5.1.3: Equipment that makes up a pumping systemPumpControl

43d1e093-68e9-480f-9656-17cd3cc7fa66,"5.1.3 Energy costs (Ce )
In the majority of cases, energy consumption is the largest 
cost in the life cycle costs of a pump system, where pumps 
often run more than 2000 hours per year.  Actually, around 
20% of the world’s electrical energy consumption is used 
for pump systems, see figure 5.1.5. 
What follows is a list of some of the factors influencing the 
energy consumption of a pump system:
• Load profile
• Pump efficiency (calculation of the duty point), see 
 figure 5.1.6
• Motor efficiency (the motor efficiency at partial load   
 can vary significantly between high efficiency motors   
 and normal efficiency motors)  
• Pump sizing (often margins and round ups tend to 
 suggest oversized pumps)
• Other system components, such as pipes and valves
• Use of speed-controlled solutions. By using speed- 
 controlled pumps in the industry, it is possible to reduce   
 the energy consumption by up to 50% 
5.1.4 Operating costs (Co )
Operating costs cover labour costs related to the operation 
of a pumping system. In most cases the labour costs 
related to the pumps are modest. Today different types 
of surveillance equipment make it possible to connect 
the pump system to a computer network, making the 
operating costs low.
5.1.5 Environmental costs(Cenv)
The environmental costs cover the disposal of parts and 
contamination from the pumped liquid. The environmental 
factor’s contribution to the life cycle costs of a pumping 
system in the industry is modest.Fig. 5.1.5: Energy consumption worldwidePump systems

Maintenance and repair costs cover as the name implies 
all costs related to maintenance and repair of the 
pump system, for example: Labour costs, spare parts, 
transportation and cleaning.
 
The best way to obtain the optimum working life of a 
pump and to prevent breakdowns is to carry out preventive  
maintenance. 
5.1.7 Downtime costs, loss of production 
costs (Cs) 
Downtime costs are extremely important when it comes 
to pump systems used in production processes. The reason 
is simple; it costs a lot of money to stop a production, even 
for a shorter period of time. Even though one pump is 
enough for the required pump performance, it is always 
a good idea to install a standby pump that can take over 
and make sure that the production continues even if an 
unexpected failure in the pump system should occur, see 
ﬁgure 5.1.7.
5.1.8 Decommissioning and disposal 
costs (Cd )
Depending on the pump manufacturer, decommissioning 
and disposal costs of a pump system are subject to minor 
variations. Therefore, this cost is seldom taken into 
consideration.
Calculating the life cycle costs
The life cycle costs of a pump system is made up of the 
summation of all the above-mentioned components over 
the system’s lifetime. Typically, the lifetime is said to be in 
the range of 10 to 20 years. In the pump business, the life 
cycle costs are normally calculated by a more simplified 
formula with fewer elements to consider. This formula is 
shown on your right.Fig. 5.1.7: Standby pump makes sure that production continues in 
case of pump break-down
LCC = Cic + Ce + Cm

977abf33-fdec-4b95-94ca-e688d25a12c0,"Let us have a look at an example using the simplified 
formula mentioned previously: An industry needs a new 
water supply pump and two solutions are taken into 
consideration:
• A fixed speed multistage centrifugal pump
• A variable speed multistage centrifugal pump
Calculations show that compared to the fixed speed pump, 
the variable speed pump consumes 40% less energy. 
However, the initial costs (Cic) of the variable speed pump 
is twice as high as that of the fixed speed pump.
Life cycle costs calculations will help determine which 
pump to install in the system . The application has the 
following characteristics:
• 12 operating hours per day
• 220 operating hours per year
• Lifetime of 10 years (calculation period)
Based on these data, it is possible to calculate the life cycle 
costs of the two solutions.
Even though the initial costs of a variable speed pump are 
twice as high compared to a fixed speed pump, the total 
costs of the first-mentioned solution are 25% lower than 
the fixed speed pump solution after 10 years.
Besides the lower life cycle costs, the variable speed pump 
provides, as discussed in chapter 4, some operational 
benefits, e.g. constant pressure in the system.
The payback time of the variable speed pump solution is a 
bit longer because the pump is more expensive. As you can 
tell from figure 5.1.9, the payback time is around 2½ years, 
and in general industrial applications, this is considered to 
be a good investment.Pump types

As discussed in chapter 3, the duty point of a pump is 
adjusted by adding a resistance in connected series with 
the pump. In practice, this is normally done by placing an 
orifice in the outlet flange of the pump.
The following graph provides the orifice diameter d [mm] 
based on the pipe/port dimension DN [mm], the flow Q 
[m3/h] and the required head loss ∆H [m]. 
Example:  
The head of a pump, with an outlet flange of 125 mm, 
has to be reduced by 25 m at a flow of 150 m3/h.
DN = 125 mm, ∆H = 25 m, Q = 150 m3/h  ⇒       
It is necessary to install an orifice with a diameter of 59 mm.d Q DNOrifice

500/400Change in static pressure due to change 
in pipe diameter
As described in chapter 2.2, a change in pipe dimension  
results in a change in liquid velocity and consequently, a 
change in dynamic and static pressure.
When the head has to be determined (see page 86), the 
difference in the two port dimensions requires a correction 
of the measured head.∆H has to be added to the measured head of the pump:
[         ]2 . gν22 - ν12
=g . π28 . Q2
=  . D241
D141_∆H
where :
v1   is the liquid velocity in the inlet port in [m/s]
v2   is the liquid velocity in the outlet port in [m/s]
Q   is the flow rate in [m3/s]
g    is the acceleration of gravity in [m/s2]
D1  is the diameter of the inlet port in [m]
D2  is the diameter of the outlet port in [m]
The graph shows the ∆H value for typical sets of  port  
dimensions  D1/D2 as  a  function of the flow Q. In this 
case flow Q is measured in [m3/h] and the ∆H is 
measured in [m].Appendix F
Example:  
A pump with an inlet port of 250 mm and an outlet 
port of 150 mm is pumping 300 m3/h. How much 
does the difference in port dimension affect the 
measured head?
D1 = 250 mm     D2 = 150 mm     Q = 300 m3/h
As it appears from the graph, the difference in 
head is ∆H = 1 m.

Kinematic viscosity is measured in centiStoke [cSt] (1 cSt = 10
-6 m2/s). The unit [SSU] Saybolt Universal is also 
used in connection with kinematic viscosity. The graph below shows the relation between kinematic viscosity in [cSt] and viscosity in [SSU]. The SAE-number is also indicated in the graph.
For kinematic viscosity above 60 cSt, the Saybolt Universal 
viscosity is calculated by the following formula:[SSU] = 4.62 . [cSt]
The densities shown in 
the graph are for 20° C",147,Grundfosliterature-5448843.pdf
